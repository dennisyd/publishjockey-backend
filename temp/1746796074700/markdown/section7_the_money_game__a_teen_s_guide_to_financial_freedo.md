# The Money Game: A Teen’s Guide to Financial Freedom

## Level Up Your Money Game - First Paycheck to Financial Boss

**Bag Builder Tips #7**: Building wealth is a three-part game.

Money earned from any source—be it a first job, a side hustle, or a burgeoning business—serves as a powerful lesson in how the world works. Every dollar you earn teaches you to spot opportunities, negotiate confidently, and bounce back when challenges arise. The sooner you grasp these principles, the faster you’ll seize control of your financial destiny. As Proverbs 14:23 reminds us, “All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty.” This simple truth underscores that wealth isn’t built by dreaming—it’s built by taking action.

Picture this: It’s a typical Monday morning. Your friends are complaining about being broke, scrolling through social media looking at things they can’t afford, and dreaming about “someday” when they’ll have money. But not you. Not anymore. Because you’re about to learn the cheat codes to the money game that most adults don’t even know. Excited? I certainly hope so.

I get it - money talk usually sounds about as exciting as watching paint dry. But what if I told you that managing your money is actually more like playing the most epic video game ever. A game where you level up in real life, where the power-ups are actual dollars in your account, and where the final boss is financial freedom.

## Level 1: Your First Job - From Newbie to Pro

### Understanding the Job Market

Before you start applying everywhere like a button-masher, let’s talk strategy. The job market is like an open-world map with different territories:

#### Entry-Level Territories:

Real Story: My friend’s son started at a Mall food court, thinking it was just about serving fries. Two years later, he was promoted to assistant manager, running social media for three locations, and making triple her starting pay. The lesson here, every job has hidden power-ups if you know where to look.

### Craft Your Character Sheet (AKA Your Résumé)

### The Interview Boss Battle

The job interview is your first major boss battle. Here’s your strategy guide which can be used at any level:

**Pre-Battle Prep:** - Research the company like you’re studying for a game speedrun - Show up early (seriously, no one ever got minus points for being early) - Dress like you already work there - Come loaded with questions that show you’re ready to play - Browse their website - Check their social media - Read recent news - Talk to current employees if possible

**Practice Common Questions** - “Why do you want to work here?” - “Tell me about yourself” - “How do you handle challenges?” - “What are your strengths/weaknesses?”

**Gear Up (Dress Code)** - Research company culture - Choose neat, clean clothing - Aim slightly more formal than daily wear - Check grooming details

**Battle Tactics:** - Arrive 15 minutes early - Bring extra resumes - Maintain eye contact - Use the STAR method for answers: - Situation - Task - Action - Result

Dylan enjoys playing video games in his spare time. He shared during his first interview at the tech store, he treated it like he was explaining game strategies to a friend - passionate but professional. The manager later said his enthusiasm was what got him hired.

### First Paycheck Power-Ups

Congratulations! You’ve landed your first job. But don’t celebrate by blowing that first paycheck like most of us have done. When you know better, you do better. Let’s talk about leveling up your money management skills.

**Understanding Your Paycheck:** (In case this was not covered at schools)

**Gross Pay vs. Net Pay** - Your gross pay is the total amount you earn before deductions. Your net pay is what you actually take home. - Common deductions: - Taxes: Federal (government) and state (local) taxes are taken out automatically. These fund public services like roads, schools, and government programs. - Social Security & Medicare (future benefits): These deductions help fund retirement and healthcare for older generations—and eventually, for you too!

**Your First Job: More Than Just a Paycheck**

Your first job is not simply a way to make money—it’s a critical introduction to how money works in the real world. Every paycheck is a lesson in budgeting, planning, and financial management.

**Managing Your First Paycheck**

Once you see the numbers, it’s time to manage your money wisely: - Save First: Aim to set aside 10–20% of each paycheck to build your savings. - Invest in Yourself: Allocate funds for courses, books, or skill-building activities that will further your personal and professional growth. - Cover Essentials: Budget for necessary expenses like transportation, food, and communications. - Give Back: Whether through tithing, donations, or simply helping a friend, remember that giving can be a powerful financial principle. - Spend Smart: Avoid impulse purchases and practice delayed gratification.

**Paycheck Management Strategy: How to Manage Your Paycheck Wisely**

### Budgeting Like a Pro

How to waste $4000 a year: Spend $10.95 a day on things you don’t need. To find extra money in your budget, look for patterns like this. A few changes to your spending habits can make a BIG impact on your bottom line.

Budgeting is the cornerstone of financial success. It’s the process of understanding where your money is coming from, where it’s going, and how to manage it effectively. This chapter will guide you through the basics of budgeting, introduce you to some popular techniques like the 50/30/20 rule, and provide practical exercises to help you create and stick to a budget that works for you, dive into the psychology of spending and saving, and create a clear path toward setting financial goals.

**Creating a Budget:** At its core, a budget is a plan for your money. - Identifying all sources of income, even small side hustles whether it’s from a part-time job, allowance, or side hustles. - Categorizing expenses to understand where your money goes food, transportation, phone bills and entertainment, etc. - Prioritizing essentials while saving for future goals even if it’s $10-20 a month. - Allocating funds for emergencies, leisure, and self-improvement even if it’s $5. - Creating a budget that supports your goals and community values.

**Stick to a Budget**

Creating a budget is only the first step—sticking to it is where the real work happens. Here’s how to stay on track: - Set Clear Goals: Understand your spending habits. What are you budgeting for? Saving for college? Buying a car? Having a goal makes sticking to your budget easier. - Automate Savings: If possible, set up automatic transfers to your savings account so you’re not tempted to spend that money. Categorize your expenses into groups like food, transportation, entertainment, and savings. - Track Your Spending: My sons and I use Mint or YNAB apps (You Need a Budget) to monitor where our money goes. - Budget Your Income: Follow the 50/30/20 rule: It is a personal favorite and one of the most popular and beginner-friendly budgeting methods. It divides your income into three categories: - 50% for needs: Calculate how much you can spend on essentials. - 30% for wants: Determine your fun spending limit. - 20% for savings and investments. Pay Yourself First

Another Budgeting Technique is the 80/20 Rule: This method focuses on saving 20% of your income and using the remaining 80% for all other expenses. This is great for people who prefer fewer categories or are just starting out.

*   Reward Yourself: Celebrate small wins. If you save $100, treat yourself to something small but meaningful to celebrate this milestone.

Remember, no single budgeting technique is perfect for everyone. The best method is the one you can stick to and that helps you achieve your financial goals. By exploring these techniques, you’ll not only find a budgeting method that works for you but also gain a deeper understanding of how to manage your money effectively.

My Strategy: I keep three bank accounts: one for everyday spending, one for saving, and one I treat like it doesn’t exist. You can set this up too—no matter how much you make. That “secret” account? It could be your down payment for your first car, your emergency stash, or the start of something big.

**Financial Tip:** As soon as you start earning a paycheck, set aside a portion—ideally 10–20%—for savings and don’t touch it. Automating your savings helps develop good financial habits from the very beginning.

**Work Benefits:** Even in entry-level jobs, you might get perks like employee discounts, tuition assistance, or even stock options (if you’re lucky). Don’t overlook these—they can be worth more than cash!

## Level 2: Monetizing Your Skills & Passions and Building Multiple Income Streams

Now, welcome to the exciting world of side hustles! Not feeling the 9-to-5 grind? A side hustle lets you earn on your own terms by turning your skills into cash. Bottom Line: If you have a talent, someone will pay for it.

Let me tell you about a real one. Just a few years ago, this woman I met was facing eviction—notice taped to her door, stress at an all-time high, and no clear way out. But what she did have was determination. She made a decision that day: no more waiting for someone to save her. She got creative, picked up a side hustle, then another, and another. She sold products online, started a small after school care business, and flipped items for profit. Each hustle became a stepping stone. Fast forward to 2025—this same woman is now earning over a million dollars a year. Let that sink in. From almost losing everything to building an empire. Don’t underestimate the power of a side hustle. When done with strategy and consistency, that “extra income” can become your main source—and your path to financial freedom.

### Here are some popular Side Hustle Ideas for Teens

**Tutoring:** Good at math, English, or science? Tutoring is a billion dollar industry. Parents will gladly pay for help with their kids’ schoolwork.

**Content Creation:** Social media is a business! If you can create valuable or entertaining content, you can monetize it through sponsorships, affiliate marketing, or ad revenue.

**Secure the Bag Tip:** Start small. Pick one hustle and commit to making your first $100. Once you hit that, scale up.

### Identifying Your Special Abilities: To Find Your Passion and Gift

Everyone has a gift! Everyone has a skill someone else is willing to pay for. For me, it’s teaching math and financial literacy—turning numbers into knowledge that changes lives. Let’s find yours: - What do friends always ask for your help with? - What could you talk about for hours? - What do you do better than most people your age? - What problems do you enjoy solving? Think about what you enjoy doing and the skills you can offer

**Test the Market:** - Start small by offering your services to friends, family, or through online communities. Early feedback will help you gauge demand and refine your offerings.

**Manage Your Time:** - Balancing a side hustle with other commitments can be challenging. Schedule dedicated hours and track your workload to maintain quality and avoid burnout.

**Leverage Online Platforms:** - Utilize gig marketplaces or social media to showcase your services, making it easy for potential clients or customers to find and pay you.

Real Results: My nephew started walking dogs after school. Built it into a pet-sitting business. Now make $2000/month managing a team of five other teen dog walkers. He is only 17.

## Level 3: Building Your Empire

### Entrepreneurship: Owning Your Financial Future

Some of the wealthiest people in the world started young. Whether it was mowing lawns, selling lemonade, or designing apps, they saw a need and filled it. Believe it!!!

**How to Start a Small Business** - Find a Problem to Solve: The best businesses solve real problems. What do people around you need? Sometimes it is the simplest business. Stop doubting yourself. - Start Small: You don’t need a big investment—just a solid idea and action. - Test the Market: Before going all in, see if people are willing to pay for what you’re offering. - Build Your Brand: Create an Instagram page, TikTok account, or website to showcase your business. - Keep Track of Your Money: Business income isn’t just profit—you have expenses, too. Use an app like QuickBooks or Wave to track what you make and spend.

Remember, if you’re under 18, you may need a parent to help you set up a business bank account or register your business.

### Entrepreneurship Challenge: Entrepreneurship: Building Your Own Game

Some of the highest-scoring players in the money game started by building their own empires. Whether it was Mr. Zuckerberg coding Facebook in his dorm room or that kid down the street in your neighborhood (or the classroom), who turned a lawn-mowing hustle into a full landscaping business, it all began with one thing: spotting a problem they could solve.

I recently met a young man who reminded me of this. He’s sharp, driven—and already running his own lawn care business. When he talked about it, you could see the passion in his eyes. And when he looked down? It usually had something to do with his mower being down—not because he was tired of the work, but because he lives for it.

With that kind of heart and hustle, I have no doubt his business will blow up after high school. He told me he’s already earning $3,000–$5,000 each summer—and get this: he’s investing it. This young man isn’t just cutting grass. He’s cutting a path straight to financial freedom. Kudos. Cas! I am so proud of you.

**Entrepreneurship Isn’t for Everyone—But Are You Up for the Challenge?**

You might have a million-dollar idea, but it won’t earn a dime if it stays in your head. The real game-changer is action. Test your idea, talk to potential customers, make a basic logo, sell one product. Just start. Every big business began with a small, brave step.

Now, your turn…Think of a business idea that solves a real problem. Write a one-page plan detailing what you’ll sell, who your customers are, and how you’ll reach them.
