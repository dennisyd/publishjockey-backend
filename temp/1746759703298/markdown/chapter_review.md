Financial Tips to Teens

Start Small, But Start Now: Whether it’s saving $10 a week or trying out a tiny side hustle, the best time to begin is now. The earlier you start, the more you can leverage time to your advantage.

Automation Is Your Friend: Whenever possible, automate your savings or bill payments. Having a portion of your paycheck automatically transferred into a savings account means you won’t forget or be tempted to spend it.

Learn to Negotiate: Whether you’re selling your artwork or being interviewed for a job, don’t be afraid to discuss compensation respectfully. You’ll never get what you don’t ask for.

Diversify Your Skills: Even if you love your job or hustle, keep learning new skills—coding, design, writing, public speaking. The more you have to offer, the easier it will be to earn.

Track Every Dollar: Being aware of your spending habits is the first step to changing them if needed. Use apps or a simple spreadsheet to track income, expenses, and saving goals.

Keep this knowledge close, and you’ll be well on your way to making the most out of every paycheck—now and in the future.
