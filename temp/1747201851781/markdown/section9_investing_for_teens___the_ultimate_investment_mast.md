Now we’re here. This chapter we’ve all been waiting for. If you’ve made it to this chapter, congratulations! This movement was ignited in the classroom when my mentees inquired about investing or expressed unfamiliarity with the stock market—things that should’ve been taught in schools to all students. This is the heart of the book’s mission: to empower teens to build lasting financial security by unlocking the power of investing—one of the most under-taught and underestimated tools in traditional education.

You don’t need a finance degree, a trust fund, or even a lot of money to start investing. What you do need is the right mindset, a little strategy, and the courage to start where you are. This is where you stop surviving and start building.

Please note this chapter isn’t about getting rich quick or making risky bets. It’s about understanding how small, consistent actions taken during your teenage years can dramatically alter your financial trajectory for life. True financial security comes from smart decisions, not just chasing fast money.

By the time you finish reading, you’ll have a clear roadmap for beginning your investment journey, legally, safely, and with the potential to reach that seven-figure milestone far earlier than most people ever dream possible. It’s time to break outdated money habits, take advantage of the time you have now, and unlock your full potential. Notebook Ready?

## Introduction: The Power of Investing Young

Imagine waking up one day in your 40s, not stressing about bills, not working a job you hate just to survive, and having the freedom to live life on your terms. That reality isn’t just for celebrities, tech geniuses, or kids born into rich families—it’s for anyone who starts investing early and makes smart financial decisions.

If you learn how to invest now, while you’re still a teen, you can set yourself up to be a millionaire by the time most people are just figuring out how to save. Time is your superpower, and the earlier you start, the more your money can grow.

Most people think you need to be rich to invest. That’s backwards. Investing is what makes you rich. And the best part? You don’t need a lot of money to start—just knowledge, discipline, and time. I will show you exactly how to invest, step by step, so you can take control of your financial future and build wealth from scratch.

### Why Investing Matters for Teens

Investing isn’t just for adults in suits. It’s a financial superpower that every teen should learn to wield. The earlier you learn to use it, the stronger it becomes. Growing up, I was only told to stay in school, get good grades and find a stable job. While most people are told to work hard and save, few are taught how to make their money work for them and grow wealth. This system has conditioned 95% of us to earn a paycheck, working for someone else, and making them rich. But the other 5%? They own, they invest, and they build wealth in their sleep. That knowledge was kept behind closed doors. With my sons, I changed the narrative. I didn’t just teach them to earn; I taught them to invest early, think long-term, and build wealth from the start.

Gentle reminder: Working for someone else alone will never make you financially free. It might cover your bills, but it won’t create wealth. And saving all your money in a conventional bank account won’t get you there either. Why? Because banks offer safety, not growth. Real wealth comes from ownership—of your time, your money, and your future. Nearly 90% of millionaires are business owners or self-employed, and they don’t just earn—they invest. They understand that money sitting still loses value, but money that’s invested multiplies. If there’s one rule to live by, it’s this: never rely on a single paycheck. So learn the game, join the 5%, and build a life where money doesn’t just come and go. Build multiple streams. Make your money work.

Start investing early. Whether it’s stocks, ETFs, real estate, or entrepreneurship, learning to invest at a young age provides a head start on financial independence, making it possible to retire earlier, start businesses, or simply have the freedom to choose how you want to live your life. That’s the mindset shift that takes you from surviving to thriving.

### Understanding the Markets: S&P 500, DOW JONES and NASDAQ 100

Most of you have probably heard about the stock market on the news, with people talking about “the Dow is up”, the “S&P” falling or “the NASDAQ took a hit.” These aren’t random codes - they’re important market indexes that act like the pulse of the financial markets.

The stock market is like a giant online store, but instead of buying sneakers or video games, millions of people are buying and selling pieces of companies (stocks) all day long. That’s essentially what the stock market is. When you buy a share of stock, you’re purchasing partial ownership in a company.

The stock market is made up of different indexes, which track the performance of groups of stocks. The NASDAQ 100 focuses on 100 of the largest non-financial companies, mostly in tech, like Tesla, Google, and Amazon. These indexes give investors a quick way to see how the market is performing overall.

The S&P 500 tracks the performance of 500 biggest companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Nike listed on U.S. stock exchanges. It’s widely considered the best representation of the U.S. stock market and the American economy. When people refer to “the market” being up or down, they’re often talking about the S&P 500.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (often called “the Dow”) is the oldest U.S. market index and tracks 30 large, publicly-owned blue-chip companies that are considered leaders in the economy. Though it contains fewer companies than the S&P 500, it’s still widely watched as a gauge of market health.

The Nasdaq 100 focuses on 100 of the largest non-financial companies, mostly in tech, like Tesla, Google, and Amazon, listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

Why should you care about these indexes? Because they give you a quick snapshot of market performance. When you hear “the market was up today,” it means most stocks gained value. These indexes also serve as benchmarks - if your investments consistently underperform the S&P 500, for instance, you might want to reconsider your strategy.

Many financial advisors recommend that beginners start by investing in funds that track these indexes rather than picking individual stocks. This approach gives you instant diversification - you’re not putting all your eggs in one basket.

It is also worth noting that the stock market isn’t one physical place anymore (though the New York Stock Exchange does have an iconic trading floor). Today, most trading happens electronically across multiple exchanges, with computers matching buyers with sellers in milliseconds. I know what you’re thinking: Was it due to Covid? The change was not caused by COVID, but COVID certainly reinforced the shift. Today, nearly all stock trades are executed digitally, often in less than a second, across various global exchanges.

Stock prices move up and down based on supply and demand, which in turn is influenced by countless factors: company performance, economic data, world events, and even human emotions like fear and greed. This is why you’ll sometimes see a company’s stock price fall even after they announce good earnings - perhaps investors were expecting even better results.

Trading hours for major U.S. markets are 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, excluding market holidays. However, there are also pre-market and after-hours trading sessions with more limited participation.

One common misconception among teens is that you need a lot of money to start investing. In reality, many brokerages now offer fractional shares, meaning you can buy a portion of a share for as little as $1. This democratization of investing means that even with your part-time job earnings, you can start building a portfolio.

### Breaking Generational Money Habits

For many of us, money habits are passed down from our families—some good, some not so great. If you grew up in a household where money was tight, or where investing wasn’t a topic of discussion as it is in most cases, you might feel like financial success is out of reach. If you’ve ever felt like financial literacy was too complicated or investing was only for adults with six-figure salaries, think again. You can break the cycle. Learning about investing now means you can make different choices, build wealth for yourself, and even change the financial future of your family. Instead of working paycheck to paycheck, you can create a life where money isn’t a constant stressor. This book will help you shift from a consumer mindset (spending every dollar you earn), to a wealth-building mindset (making money work for you). Financial freedom comes from ownership. Investors own things such as stocks, businesses and real estate, not just paychecks.

### The Power of Starting Young: Why Investing Young is the Ultimate Cheat Code to Wealth

Most people spend their lives working for money, but what if your money could start working for you instead? The biggest advantage you have on your side as a teen isn’t a huge paycheck; it’s time, something more valuable than money itself. Time is inarguably your MOST valuable asset. The earlier you start investing, the more you can benefit from compound interest, which allows your money to grow exponentially over time. Think of it like a video game where you unlock a hidden level that doubles your rewards the longer you play. Starting young is the ultimate cheat code because even small investments today can turn into massive wealth in the future. The difference between starting at 16 versus 30 isn’t just a few extra years—it could mean the difference between having thousands versus millions by the time you retire.

Imagine by the time you’re in your mid 30’s or 40’s, you could already be halfway or more toward your first million dollars. That reality isn’t just for celebrities, tech geniuses, or kids born into rich families; it’s not because you won the lottery, where the odds are a staggering one in 292.2 million. It is simply for anyone who starts investing early and makes smart financial decisions when they are in their teens. This isn’t a fantasy—it’s the mathematical genius of compound interest, often called the eighth wonder of the world.

Starting to invest as a teen gives you a huge advantage. While your friends are spending their money on the latest gadgets, shoes or fashion trends and others are just figuring out how to save, remember you have the opportunity to plant financial seeds that will grow into lasting wealth over decades to come. Time is your superpower. The earlier you start, the more your money will grow. The best part? Yes, you don’t need to be rich to start investing. That’s the wrong mindset. Investing is what makes you wealthy. All you need is knowledge, discipline, and time.

Unfortunately, I started investing much older than 16, so I had to play catch up. Therefore, I made sure Yancy and Dylan started investing in their teens. This book is about more than just teaching financial literacy to teens and young adults, it’s about giving them a head start that will pay off big in their future. My goal is to break things down in an accessible way to help teens understand how to use their time as an asset. Don’t worry if you’re new to stocks, bonds, or crypto—I’ll guide you through it. In the chapters ahead, I’ll break it all down in simple terms and show you step-by-step how to start investing today—even with just a small amount.

### The Magic Power of Compound Interest: Your Money’s Secret Superpower - Understanding the Math: How Early Investing Creates Millionaires

If you take nothing else from this book, remember this: Compound Interest is the closest thing to free money you’ll ever get. Albert Einstein allegedly called compound interest “the most powerful force in the universe” noting that “he who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.” While historians debate whether Einstein actually said this, the sentiment remains powerfully true. Compound interest is the single greatest advantage young investors possess, and understanding its power might be the most valuable financial lesson you’ll ever learn. But what exactly is Compound Interest and why is it so powerful?

Compound interest is the process of earning interest not just on your initial investment but also on the interest that accumulates over time. It’s often called the “eighth wonder of the world” because it has the power to turn small, consistent investments into massive wealth over time. Unlike simple interest, which only grows based on the original amount invested, compound interest allows your money to snowball—growing larger and faster the longer it remains invested. The earlier you start, the more time your money has to compound, turning even small investments into life-changing amounts. That’s why starting young is the ultimate financial cheat code—a head start that can mean the difference between struggling financially and achieving long-term wealth with ease. This isn’t just about becoming rich (though that’s nice too); it’s about creating options for yourself. Whether you want to buy a home, travel the world, start a business, or retire early, investing now gives you the freedom to choose your path later.

Let’s put it in perspective and look at three simple examples:

1.  Imagine you made a single investment of a $1,000 at age fifteen in an investment that earns 10% annually (approximately the historical average return of the S&P 500 index over the long term, adjusted for inflation). By the end of the first year, you’d have $1,100. By the end of the second year, you wouldn’t just have $1,200—you’d have $1,210, because you earned interest on your interest. This might seem like a small difference, but watch what happens over time:
    *   After 10 years (age 25): $2,594
    *   After 20 years (age 35): $6,728
    *   After 30 years (age 45): $17,449
    *   After 40 years (age 55): $45,259
    *   After 50 years (age 65): $117,391

That’s right. Let that sink in. Your $1,000, that you could’ve spent on shoes or other futile items, becomes over $117,000 without you adding another penny and just forgetting about it.

**Bag Builder Tip:** The earlier you invest, the harder your money works. A single $1,000 investment at age 15 can grow to over $117,000 by retirement—without adding another dime. That’s the quiet power of compound interest.

1.  Let’s look at a second example. Let’s say instead of a 1-time investment, you decide to invest just $100 per month starting at age 16 and earn an average 10% return in the stock market, you could have $203,485 (almost 1 quarter of a million dollars) by age 45 and over $500,000 (half a million) by retirement—even though you only contributed around $30,000 of your own money! Now, if you waited until age 25 to start investing $100 per month at a 10% annual return, by age 45, you would have approximately $76,570, which is significantly less than you would have if you started at 16. This highlights the power of starting early. The longer your money stays invested, the bigger your returns.
2.  Let’s compare two investors: Skai and Jordan

Let’s break this down. We have two investors: You (Skai the one who starts early) and Jordan (who waits until 26 to start investing).

You start at 16 and invest $100 a month for just 10 years (until age 26). After that, you stop adding money but leave it invested until retirement at 65. Total contribution? $12,000 ($100 12 months 10 years).

Jordan waits until 26 to start investing, but then contributes $100 a month for 39 years (until age 65). Total contribution? $46,800 ($100 12 months 39 years).

So, Jordan invests way more money than you—almost four times as much! But here’s the kicker: You still end up with more money. Why? Time + Compound Growth = The Ultimate Money Cheat Code.

Let’s do the math, assuming both accounts grow at an 8% average annual return: - Your investment grows to about $306,000 by age 65—even though you only contributed $12,000! - Jordan’s investment grows to about $283,000 by age 65—even after contributing $46,800!

Who wins? YOU (period!). By nearly $23,000.

And here’s the mind-blowing part—you only invested for 10 years, while Jordan invested for 39 years. This isn’t financial wizardry, it’s the mathematics of compound returns. The money you invest early has more time to grow, and that growth itself begins generating returns. Again like the earlier analogy of a snowball rolling downhill, gathering more snow with each rotation and growing larger at an accelerating pace.

If these numbers don’t immediately strike you as remarkable, consider this: Skai invested for only ten years but ended up with more money than Jordan, who diligently invested for nearly four decades. The message couldn’t be clearer: when it comes to investing, time is more valuable than money. This is The Prize of starting early. Your money works harder for you the longer it has to grow. The earlier you start, the less you have to invest to build serious wealth.

Most people work hard for money. Wealthy people make money work for them. That’s what investing is—putting your money into things that grow over time and with the power of compound interest—your money making money on top of money so you don’t have to work forever.

Lesson? Don’t wait. Start now. Even if it’s just a little. Your future self will thank you.

Now that we’ve explored the “8th wonder” of the world—compound interest—let’s talk about how to protect your investments and grow your money in the face of inflation.

Let’s turn attention to something that doesn’t always make headlines but impacts every dollar in your wallet: inflation. Why does your money lose value over time and what to do about it?

Envision this—you walk into your favorite fast-food spot, ready to grab your favorite meal. A few years ago, that Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich cost $4.99. Fast forward today, that same sandwich costs $7. What changed? Not the sandwich. That’s inflation at work—slowly, silently shrinking the power of your dollar.

Inflation is like a slow leak in your wallet. It means that over time, prices for things such as food, clothes, gas, even concert tickets increase, while the value of each dollar goes down and buys you less and less. If your money isn’t growing, it’s actually shrinking in buying power: . - In 2000, a movie ticket cost about $6. Now, it’s about $15. - A gallon of milk was around $2. Now? Nearly $5 in some places. - The same pair of sneakers that once cost $80 now pushes $150, especially if they’re hyped and so on. Inflation affects everything.

So what does this mean for you? If your money is just sitting in a piggy bank—or even in a basic savings account with low interest—it’s actually losing value over time. Saving is smart, but I can not say it enough: Saving alone will never make you rich. So, while investing is a powerful way to build wealth, it’s also important to understand that inflation can work against you if you don’t take it into account.

That’s why we invest. It’s about defending your money from inflation. If you want to beat inflation, you have to outpace it. And the best way to do that? Start investing early and consistently. The earlier you start, the better your chances of growing your money faster than inflation can catch up and outpace inflation.

### Breaking Down Myths: Investing is not only for adults and You Don’t Need a Lot of Money to Start

One of the biggest lies out there? “I need a lot of money to invest.” Nope. 100% False. Investing isn’t just for the rich—it’s for everyone. Even small amounts turn into big wins over time. You just have to show up and start.

You can start investing with as little as $5. Yes, the same $5 you might spend on a coffee, a snack on the vending machine at school, or a cheap app on your phone. Thanks to fractional shares, you don’t need to buy a full share of expensive stocks like Apple or Tesla—you can buy pieces of them for a few bucks. Think about it:

*   You spend $10 on a streaming subscription every month. What if you put that same $10 into a stock that makes you money instead?
*   You drop $20 on fast food every weekend. What if you put that $20 into an investment account?

Starting small adds up. Let’s do the math: If you invest just $10 a week at 8% growth (which is close to the average stock market return), in 10 years, that’s nearly $8,000. Keep going for 30 years? That’s over $60,000—and that’s with just $10 a week. If you can do more, the numbers get even crazier.

Many teens also think investing is something only adults with careers should worry about. Nothing could be further from the truth. The decisions you make now, even with small amounts of money, can dramatically shape your financial future. That $50 birthday money from grandma? Invested instead of spent, it could be worth hundreds by the time you finish college.

“Time is your friend; impulse is your enemy. Take advantage of compound interest and don’t be captivated by the siren song of the market.” - Warren Buffet & for a child’s portfolio starting with fractional shares in the highest quality / grade dividend companies.

Get to know his name. Mr. Warren Buffett. You can’t talk about investing—especially stocks—without mentioning Warren Buffett. His name is legendary for a reason. When it comes to building long-term wealth, studying his moves is like getting the playbook from one of the greatest to ever do it. One of the greatest investors of all time,

A business prodigy, Buffett bought his first stock when he was just 11 years old. He then used savings to buy and install pinball machines in local shops when he was still a teenager. Fast forward: Mr. Buffett is now worth over $100 billion, and he built it not through luck, but through smart decisions, patience, and a long-term mindset. He’s living proof that you don’t have to be born rich to build wealth—you just need vision, discipline, and a plan.

If you take anything from his story, it’s this: Start now. Start small. Stay consistent. Even the greatest started with just a few dollars and a bold idea.

If you’re serious about investing, get to know his name. Study how the greats play the game; then use what you learn to build your own lane.

## Investment Vehicles for Teens: Where to Begin

As a teenager, several investment accounts are available to you, each with distinct advantages. Understanding these options is crucial to making informed decisions about where to place your hard-earned money.

#### Custodial Accounts: Your Gateway to Investing

Custodial accounts—typically UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) or UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) accounts—remain the most accessible starting point for most teen investors. These accounts are established by an adult (usually a parent or guardian) on your behalf until you reach the age of majority (18 or 21, depending on your state).

The beauty of custodial accounts lies in their flexibility. You can invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and even alternative investments like cryptocurrency (where legally permitted). While the adult custodian technically controls the account until you reach adulthood, the money legally belongs to you.

I recommend that teens begin investing as early as age 15—not necessarily with a large sum of money, but with curiosity and consistency. Start by sitting down with your parents or a trusted adult and researching companies that genuinely interest you.

I always encourage young investors to begin with brands they already know and use in their everyday lives—companies like Apple, Nike, or Sony. Investing in familiar brands makes the process feel tangible and real. You’re not just buying stock—you’re becoming a part-owner of companies whose products you interact with regularly. That connection builds confidence, excitement, and a stronger understanding of how the market works.

There are important limitations to understand with custodial accounts. Once funds are placed in a custodial account, they cannot be taken back—they legally belong to the minor. When you reach the age of majority, you gain complete control over the account. Additionally, if they hold a significant amount of money, they can affect college financial aid eligibility because they’re counted as the student’s assets in financial aid calculations.

#### Roth IRAs for Teens: The Tax-Free Wonder

If you have earned income from a job—whether it’s lifeguarding, babysitting, or working at a local business—a Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) might be ‘theeee’ most powerful investment vehicle available to you. A custodial Roth IRA works similar to a standard custodial account but with extraordinary tax advantages.

With a Roth IRA, you contribute money that has already been taxed, but the magic happens when you withdraw it. After age 59½, all withdrawals—including all the growth your investments have achieved over decades—are completely tax-free. For young investors with decades of growth ahead, this tax advantage is immensely valuable.

I cannot stress: If you put $2,000 a year (about $42 a week) into a Roth IRA from age 16 to 22—just through college—and then never contributed again, you could potentially have a million dollars tax-free by retirement. That is absolutely mindblowing.

Constant reminder: If you contribute $2,000 annually (about $42 a week) to a Roth IRA from age 16 to 22 and then never contribute again, you could potentially have a million dollars tax-free by retirement. That is absolutely mindblowing. Thanks to the power of compound interest (our bestie). Here’s how it works:

Total Contributions: $14,000 over seven years ($2,000 x 7). Time Horizon: From age 22 to 65, your investments would have 43 years to grow without additional contributions. Using a compound interest calculator, the $14,000 invested would grow to approximately $1 million by age 65, assuming an 8% average annual return (a common estimate for long-term stock market returns).

The contribution limit for Roth IRAs in 2025 is $7,000, but you can only contribute up to the amount you earned that year. If you earned $3,000 from your summer job, that’s your contribution limit, even if your parents are providing the money for the actual investment.

There’s another hidden benefit to Roth IRAs that makes them particularly flexible for young people: You can withdraw your original contributions (but not the earnings) at any time without penalties or taxes. This provides a financial safety net that other retirement accounts don’t offer.

#### Brokerage Platforms for Teens

Several investment platforms cater specifically to young investors, offering user-friendly interfaces and educational resources:

**Fidelity Youth Account**, one of my favorites for teen investors, allows teens 13-17 to invest, save, and spend with parental oversight. It transitions to a standard brokerage account at age 18 and offers commission-free trading of stocks, ETFs, and Fidelity mutual funds. Why it’s great: It’s a legit, real-world investing experience that gives teens a ton of responsibility and insight.

**Greenlight** combines a debit card with investing capabilities for kids and teens. Parents can approve trades, and the platform includes educational content about the companies available for investment.

**Stockpile** offers fractional shares, allowing teens to own portions of expensive stocks like Amazon or Google with as little as $5. Gift cards for stock purchases make this platform particularly accessible for teens receiving financial gifts from family members.

**Acorns Early** (formerly Acorns Family) offers custodial accounts with automatic investing features that can help develop consistent investing habits. Their “round-up” feature automatically invests spare change from purchases.

### Asset Classes: Building Your Investment Portfolio

Understanding different asset classes is essential for building a diversified portfolio that can weather various economic conditions while growing your wealth over time.

#### Stocks: Ownership in the World’s Companies

To buy or sell stocks, you’ll need one of the brokerage accounts \*see popular platform options listed above, that are specifically designed for young investors. Think of a brokerage as the middleman that connects you to the stock market. When you buy stock, you’re purchasing a small piece of ownership in a company. As that company grows and becomes more profitable, your share of ownership becomes more valuable. Many companies also distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders as dividends.

When you’re buying stocks, you’ll encounter different types of orders. A market order buys or sells the stock immediately at the current available price. It’s the fastest way to buy or sell, but you don’t have control over the exact price. A limit order, meanwhile, only executes at or better than a price you specify. I often put a limit order when I am buying stocks because it gives me more control but be aware it doesn’t guarantee your order will be filled.

When you’re buying stocks, you’ll encounter different types of orders. A market order buys or sells the stock immediately at the current available price. It’s the fastest way to buy or sell quick; but you don’t have control over the exact price—you just take what the market offers.

A limit order is different. You set the price you’re willing to pay (or accept), and the order only goes through if the stock hits that price or better. Depending on the stock, I like to use a limit order when I buy stocks because it gives me more control over what I’m paying. But here’s the catch: it’s not guaranteed to go through—if the stock never hits your price, your order won’t be filled.

Ultimately, the price you pay depends on supply and demand—how many people are trying to buy or sell that stock at any moment. When selling stocks, you hope to sell for more than you paid, making a profit. However, prices can go down too, which is why managing risk is important.

The mechanics of trading have become incredibly simple with modern apps and websites. You can literally buy shares in major companies with a few taps on your phone. The real challenge isn’t the mechanics of buying and selling; it’s knowing what to buy, when to buy it, and when to sell. Remember that every time you trade, you’ll likely pay some form of cost - either through commissions (though many brokerages now offer commission-free trading) or through the “spread,” which is the difference between the buying and selling price. Frequent trading can eat into your returns, which is why many successful investors prefer a “buy and hold” approach.

Stocks offer the highest potential returns among traditional asset classes—approximately 10% average annual return historically before inflation—but also come with higher volatility. This means their value can fluctuate significantly in the short term, sometimes losing substantial value during market downturns.

For young investors with decades ahead, this volatility is less concerning. You have time to ride out market downturns and benefit from the long-term upward trajectory of the market. This is why most financial advisors recommend that young investors allocate a larger portion of their portfolios to stocks.

Individual stock picking requires research and understanding of business fundamentals, competitive advantages, and valuation metrics. While selecting individual companies can be educational and engaging, it also carries concentrated risk if those specific companies underperform.

### HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST STOCKS TO BUY

Choosing stocks isn’t about guessing, finding “hot tips” or following social media investment gurus. I have suffered huge losses following so-called experts. It’s about understanding companies and making informed decisions based on their fundamental value and growth potential. It’s about research. Learn at a young age to do your own due diligence.

Look for companies that are consistently making money, have a strong leadership team, and are in industries that are growing. Start by investing in what you know. Are there products or services you use daily? Companies like Apple, Nike, or Chipotle might be familiar to you. Understanding a company’s business model gives you an edge.

When evaluating a stock, look at both quantitative factors (numbers) and qualitative factors (things that can’t be easily measured). Quantitative factors include: - Revenue growth: Is the company selling more over time? - Earnings per share (EPS): Is the company profitable, and are those profits growing? - Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E): How expensive is the stock relative to its earnings? - Debt levels: How much does the company owe, and can it easily pay its obligations?

Qualitative factors include: - Competitive advantage: What makes this company special compared to competitors? - Management quality: Are the leaders making good decisions? - Industry trends: Is the company in a growing or shrinking industry?

Don’t be intimidated by financial statements. Start with the basics - income statements show revenue and expenses, balance sheets show assets and liabilities, and cash flow statements show money moving in and out. Financial websites like Yahoo Finance or apps like Robinhood provide simplified versions of these reports.

Reminder: Just because a stock went up in the past doesn’t mean it’ll keep going up. Past performance isn’t a promise for future results. A stock might have been hot last year, but that doesn’t guarantee it’ll keep rising.

And on the flip side, just because a stock is dropping doesn’t mean it’s a good deal. Sometimes stocks are “cheap” for a reason—they could be losing money, in serious trouble, or on the path to getting delisted (removed from the stock exchange). I’ve had a few that got delisted because I held on too long, thinking they’d bounce back. They didn’t.

Understanding price trends can help you make better entry and exit decisions. While no one can predict stock movements with certainty, technical analysis provides tools to identify patterns and trends. For teens, I recommend starting with simple trend observation before diving into complex indicators. Ask yourself: “Is this stock generally moving up, down, or sideways over the last few months?” This basic trend awareness can help you avoid buying into falling markets or selling too early in rising ones.

Here’s the lesson: don’t get too emotional with stocks. It’s easy to fall in love with a company or get caught up in hype, but your goal is to grow your money—not ride a stock all the way down. Set your plan, know your limits, and if it’s time to move on… move on. Protect the bag.

### DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO BUY STOCKS

#### There’s More Than One Way to Build Wealth

When it comes to investing, there’s no one-size-fits-all strategy. The truth is, the best approach is the one that fits you—your goals, your risk tolerance, and your timeline. In my own family, we all invest in the stock market, but now, our styles couldn’t be more different.

My husband? He’s bold. You won’t catch him touching crypto, but he’s more aggressive when it comes to things like covered calls, options, and puts—strategies that require experience and aren’t something I’d recommend for teens just starting out.

My oldest son YD is more conservative and focused. He sticks to powerhouse companies like Microsoft, Apple, and NVIDIA—and just recently, I convinced him to dive into quantum computing. He also consistently invests a set amount into QQQ each month, showing that slow and steady really can win the race. No meme stocks or risky moves for him—just solid, long-term plays.

Then there’s my youngest, Dylan—calm, focused, and intentional. He takes a steady, long-term approach to investing and is all about building a strong financial foundation from the ground up. His portfolio is heavy on ETFs, and he’s laser-focused on his Roth IRA—already thinking about the long game. You’ll hear him talk about VOO, VUG, SCHD, and yes, QQQ too. He’s stacking smart, staying focused, and already securing the bag.

As for me? I’ve got a diversified mix. I spread my investments across multiple sectors—tech, AI, quantum computing, and yes, even a few penny stocks and cryptos like BTC and ETH. Some of those have been winners, and others… Well, let’s just say I learned a lesson or two. But that’s part of the journey.

What matters most is this: we’re all playing the game, just in different ways. And that’s the beauty of investing—you can tailor your portfolio to fit your goals. You don’t have to follow someone else’s blueprint. You just have to start.

Different strategies work for different people, depending on their goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some common approaches and ways to invest and each has its own advantages:

**Value Investing**: This approach, popularized by Warren Buffett, involves looking for stocks trading below their intrinsic value - essentially companies on sale. These companies that are undervalued (their stock price is lower than it should be). Value investors analyze financial statements carefully and have the patience to wait for the market to recognize a company’s true worth.

**Growth Investing**: Growth investors focus on companies expected to grow their revenue and earnings faster than average. These stocks often look expensive by traditional metrics but may deliver superior returns if the company executes well. Many tech stocks fall into this category. Focus on companies that are expanding quickly, like Tesla or NVIDIA.

**Dividend Investing**: Some companies regularly distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders as dividends. Dividend investing focuses on these companies, which tend to be more established and less volatile. The appeal is two-fold: regular income plus potential stock price appreciation.

**Index Investing**: Rather than trying to pick winning stocks, index investors buy funds that track entire markets or sectors. This passive approach is simple, low-cost, and has historically outperformed most active strategies over the long term.

**Dollar-Cost Averaging**: This isn’t so much a stock-picking strategy as a method of accumulating shares over time. You invest a fixed amount of money regularly, regardless of market conditions, whether the market is up or down. When prices are high, you buy fewer shares; when prices are low, you buy more. This helps reduce the impact of volatility and removes the stress of trying to time the market.

As a teen investor, consider starting with index funds or blue-chip companies with strong fundamentals and products you understand. As you gain knowledge and experience, you can explore more sophisticated strategies.

Other types of investment include **Bonds**: Lending Your Money for Interest. Bonds represent loans to governments, municipalities, or corporations. When you buy a bond, you’re essentially lending money to the issuer, who promises to pay you interest at regular intervals before returning your principal at maturity.

Bonds generally offer lower returns than stocks—historically around 3-5% annually before inflation—but with reduced volatility. They provide steady income and can help preserve capital during stock market downturns.

For young investors, bonds typically play a smaller role in the portfolio. However, understanding bonds is important as they’ll likely become a larger component of your investment strategy as you approach major financial goals or retirement.

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Instant Diversification

ETFs have revolutionized investing, particularly for those just starting out. These investment vehicles trade like stocks but contain portfolios of many underlying assets, offering instant diversification. An S&P 500 ETF, for instance, provides exposure to the 500 largest publicly traded U.S. companies with a single purchase.

ETFs come with several advantages for teen investors: - Low minimum investments: Many ETFs trade for less than $100 per share, and fractional share investing allows you to start with even less. - Automatic diversification: Even with $100, you can own tiny pieces of hundreds of companies. - Low costs: Many ETFs have expense ratios below 0.1%, meaning you pay less than $1 annually per $1,000 invested. - Tax efficiency: Most ETFs generate fewer taxable events than actively managed mutual funds.

Here’s a simple yet powerful strategy for an 18-year-old just starting out: begin investing with just $25 a month in a total market ETF. While it may seem like a small amount, the goal is to build the habit early. By investing in a total market ETF, you gain exposure to thousands of companies across various industries and regions, giving you instant diversification. You’re not just buying stock—you’re becoming a shareholder in over 3,000 businesses around the world. This approach offers real-world experience and insight into how the market operates, while minimizing risk and setting a solid foundation for long-term wealth building.

### Index Funds: \*The Proven Strategy

Index funds are collections of many stocks, whether in ETF or mutual fund format, aimed to match the performance of a specific market index rather than outperform it. This “passive” investment approach has consistently outperformed the majority of actively managed funds over long time periods.

The simplicity of index investing makes it particularly suitable for teen investors. A portfolio consisting of just a few broad-based index funds can provide global diversification across thousands of stocks and bonds. A basic three-fund portfolio might include: - A total U.S. stock market index fund - An international stock index fund - A U.S. bond index fund

This simple approach provides comprehensive market exposure with minimal complexity and extremely low costs. The specific allocation between these funds would depend on your risk tolerance and time horizon, though young investors typically benefit from a stock-heavy approach.

### Alternative Investments: Beyond the Basics

While stocks, bonds, and funds should form the core of most teen investment portfolios, understanding alternative investments can provide additional perspective and opportunities.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) allow you to invest in portfolios of properties without directly buying real estate. They typically offer higher dividend yields than many stocks and provide exposure to an entirely different asset class.

### CRYPTOCURRENCIES: APPROACH WITH CAUTION

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have generated tremendous interest, especially among young people. I have invested in BTC, ETH, SOLANA SHIBA for a number of years. While they’ve created some remarkable success stories, they’ve also led to significant losses. As a teen investor, it’s important to understand what they are and why caution is warranted.

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security and operate on technology called blockchain, which is essentially a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (fiat currencies), most cryptocurrencies are decentralized.

The appeal is obvious: crypto assets have seen periods of explosive growth that far outpace traditional investments. Bitcoin, for instance, went from being worth almost nothing in 2010 to reaching heights above $100,000 this year. Stories of teenage crypto millionaires make headlines and fuel interest.

However, with potential high rewards comes extraordinary risk. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile - it’s not uncommon for prices to swing 10% or more in a single day. They’re also still largely speculative investments without the underlying earnings or cash flows that stocks have.

Regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of risk. Governments worldwide are still figuring out how to approach cryptocurrencies, and regulatory changes can dramatically impact prices.

For teens interested in learning about crypto, here’s Mrs. D’s advice: if you do decide to explore this space, only use money you can afford to lose completely - think of it as an educational expense rather than a core investment. Start with tiny amounts to learn how the technology and markets work. Personally, I only allocate about 1.5% of my investment portfolio to cryptocurrencies. The vast majority of your investments should remain in more traditional assets like stocks, which have centuries of history and more predictable long-term returns.

If your interest is primarily in the technology rather than speculation, consider learning about blockchain development or how various crypto projects work. This knowledge could be valuable regardless of where crypto prices go, as the underlying technology has applications beyond digital currencies.

Remember that many successful investors like Warren Buffett have achieved tremendous wealth without ever touching cryptocurrencies. You don’t need exotic investments to build financial security - consistent investing in quality companies over time has proven to be a reliable path to wealth.

Again, always consult with your parents, guardians, or a trusted adult before making any financial decisions.

### Quick Recap: What’s the Difference? Stocks vs. ETFs vs. Index Funds

In short: - Stocks = One company - ETFs = Many companies, traded like a stock - Index Funds = Track an entire market, usually built to grow slow and strong

## Managing Risk

Risk management might sound boring, but it’s actually what separates successful investors of all ages from those who flame out. Think of it as the seatbelt of investing - it might not be the exciting part, but it keeps you safe when things get turbulent and volatile.

The most fundamental risk management strategy is diversification - not putting all your eggs in one basket. By spreading your investments across different companies, sectors, and even asset classes, you reduce the impact of any single investment performing poorly.

For teens, here’s a simple diversification approach: If you’re just starting, I cannot stress it enough, simply buy an index fund that gives you exposure to hundreds of companies in one purchase.

Position sizing is another key concept. This refers to how much of your portfolio you allocate to any single investment. A common rule of thumb is not to put more than 5% of your portfolio into any one stock. This way, even if that investment goes to zero (rare, but possible), you’ve only lost a small portion of your total portfolio.

Understanding your time horizon is crucial for risk management. Money you might need in the next year or two should generally not be invested in stocks, as short-term market volatility could force you to sell at an inopportune time. However, money you’re investing for long-term goals can withstand market fluctuations.

Stop-loss orders can help limit your downside. These are instructions to sell a stock if it falls to a certain price. For example, if you buy a stock at $100, you might set a stop-loss at $85, limiting your potential loss to 15%. However, be careful with setting stop-losses too tight, as normal market volatility might trigger them unnecessarily.

Finally, it’s important to understand that one of the biggest risks in investing isn’t the market itself—it’s your own emotions. Fear and greed are powerful forces that can lead even the most well-intentioned investors to make poor decisions, such as buying high and selling low, which is the exact opposite of a sound investment strategy.

Let me give you a real example. When my oldest child first began investing, he purchased shares in a reputable semiconductor company. It was a smart pick—strong fundamentals, solid leadership, and a clear role in shaping the future of tech. But shortly afterward, geopolitical tensions and newly imposed tariffs shook the market, sending the stock price tumbling from $180 to $135 per share.

Understandably shaken, he panicked and sold his shares first thing Monday morning—locking in a loss. But here’s the kicker: just five minutes later, the stock rebounded sharply to $160. If he had held on just a little longer, he could’ve nearly recovered his position. Having a written investment plan that you stick to regardless of market conditions can help mitigate these emotional reactions.

The lesson? Emotional discipline is just as critical as knowing how to read a balance sheet. Markets move in cycles, and temporary setbacks are inevitable. The investors who succeed in the long run are those who stay the course, trust their strategy, and don’t let fear drive their decisions.

## Practical Investment Strategies for Teens

With an understanding of investment accounts and asset classes, let’s explore practical strategies to begin and maintain your investment journey.

### Strategy 1: Start Small, But Start Now

The most important step in investing isn’t how much you start with—it’s simply beginning. Many teens assume they need substantial sums to start investing meaningfully, but this misconception can cost years of potential growth.

My nephew began investing with just $10 weekly from his allowance at age 14. Some of his friends thought it was pointless to “bother with such small amounts,” I recall. But four years later, he has built a portfolio worth over $3,000, learned incredible skills, and developed financial habits that will benefit him forever.

With fractional shares and no-minimum investment platforms, you can begin building your portfolio with as little as $5. Please start and share with me your progress on my Instagram page teens.finance101. The psychological benefit of getting started often provides motivation to increase your contributions as your income grows.

### Strategy 2: Embrace Dollar-Cost Averaging

Do not try to time the market—that strategy consistently fails for everyone and even professional investors. Commit to investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. This approach, called dollar-cost averaging, removes emotion from the equation and ensures you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high.

Setting up automatic transfers from a checking account or summer job earnings into your investment account eliminates the temptation to spend rather than invest. Remember, even $20 weekly automatically invested builds both wealth and discipline.

### Strategy 3: Harness the Power of Dividends

Dividend-paying stocks and funds distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders, typically quarterly. Reinvesting these dividends—purchasing additional shares rather than taking the cash—accelerates the compounding process.

Most investment platforms offer automatic dividend reinvestment programs (DRIPs) that handle this process seamlessly. Over time, reinvested dividends can account for a substantial portion of your investment returns. Historically, dividends have contributed approximately 40% of the stock market’s total return.

Imagine this: money is flowing into your account while you’re asleep. Sounds too good to be true? It’s not! That’s the power of dividends. The best part? You can reinvest those dividends and let them multiply—so your money is making more money. The more you let it grow, the more it grows. Imagine turning a small investment into a snowball of wealth that keeps getting bigger, even while you’re off doing something else. Pretty exciting, right?

### Strategy 4: Invest in What You Understand

Peter Lynch, one of history’s most successful fund managers, famously advised investors to “buy what you know.” As a teenager, you possess valuable insight into emerging trends, products, and services popular among your generation.

I personally invested in Nvidia after seeing how important graphics processing was becoming for gaming and later for artificial intelligence (AI). I understood the product and saw its growing importance before many older investors recognized the trend.

This doesn’t mean investing only in trendy companies or products you use. Fundamentals and valuation still matter but your perspective as a young consumer provides a valuable lens for identifying potential opportunities.

### Strategy 5: Develop Your Investment Philosophy

As you gain experience, work toward developing a coherent investment philosophy, a set of principles and beliefs that guide your decisions. Your philosophy might emphasize growth, value, dividend income, social responsibility, or some combination of approaches.

Having a clear philosophy helps maintain consistency during market volatility and provides a framework for evaluating new investment opportunities. It transforms reactive decisions into thoughtful choices aligned with your long-term objectives.

## Navigating Common Investment Challenges for Teens

The path to investment success isn’t always smooth. Understanding common challenges can help you navigate them effectively.

### Challenge 1: Market Volatility and Emotional Discipline

The stock market might look like it always goes up over time—and it does grow overall—but that doesn’t mean the ride is smooth. Since 1928, the S&P 500 (basically a big scoreboard of the top 500 U.S. companies) has dropped by around 14% at some point every single year. Yep, even in the years it ended up doing well overall—about 3 out of 4 years, by the way—it still had some serious dips along the way.

For teen investors experiencing their first market correction or bear market, these downturns can be psychologically challenging. The natural impulse to “do something” during market declines typically leads to poor decisions, like selling at low points.

Developing emotional discipline—the ability to stick with your investment plan during turbulent markets—may be the most valuable skill you cultivate. Historical data consistently shows that investors who stay the course during downturns achieve significantly better results than those who try to time the market.

When markets decline, remind yourself that temporary drops in portfolio value aren’t “losses” unless you sell. For long-term investors, market downturns represent excellent opportunities to purchase assets at discounted prices.

### Challenge 2: Information Overload and Financial Media

Today’s investors face a barrage of financial information, much of it designed to provoke emotional reactions rather than support rational decision-making. 24-hr Business television networks, investment websites, and social media personalities often emphasize short-term market movements and predictions, which have little relevance to long-term investors.

Develop the ability to filter information based on its actual relevance to your investment strategy. Pay more attention to fundamental business results and less to daily price movements or short-term forecasts. Remember that financial media companies profit from your attention, not from the quality of your investment results. I have lost a lot of money listening to so-called experts on tv. Do your own due diligence.

### Challenge 3: Social Pressures and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

Investment decisions influenced by peers or fear of missing out often lead to concentrated risk and poor timing. I remember vividly the cryptocurrency boom of 2021, meme stock frenzies, and viral investment crazes show how hype and social media can drive people to make emotional money moves. Take GameStop, AMC, and Dogecoin—names that lit up TikTok and Twitter. Teens watched prices skyrocket overnight, and many jumped in late, hoping to cash in quick. But when the dust settled, some made money, while others lost big. These moments weren’t always based on solid business fundamentals—they were driven by FOMO (fear of missing out).

When everyone was jumping into GameStop, Yance felt stupid for sticking with his ‘boring index funds’. For weeks, his friends were bragging about massive gains. Then came the crash, and suddenly no one was talking about it anymore. The lesson here is that spectacular but temporary gains make better stories than steady, long-term growth.

Smart investing isn’t about chasing trends; it’s about playing the long game and understanding the value behind what you buy.

Building conviction in your investment approach helps resist these social pressures. Understanding the historical performance of various strategies and the mathematics of building wealth provides confidence to stick with proven approaches, even when they seem less exciting than the latest investment trend.

### Challenge 4: Balancing Present Enjoyment with Future Security

As a teen, you face legitimate competing priorities for your money—social activities, hobbies, education, and early independence. Finding the right balance between present enjoyment and future financial security represents one of life’s fundamental financial challenges.

There’s no perfect formula, but the 50/30/20 framework that I talked to at the beginning of this book, provides a starting point: 50% of income for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and investing. Your specific circumstances might suggest different allocations, but establishing some intentional division helps ensure you’re addressing both present quality of life and future financial goals.

## The Mindset of Successful Teen Investors

Beyond specific strategies and techniques, certain mindsets characterize successful young investors.

### Growth Mindset: Embracing the Learning Journey

Investment success requires continuous learning. Markets evolve, new opportunities emerge, and your own financial situation changes over time. Approaching investing with curiosity and openness to learning from both successes and mistakes creates a foundation for lifelong financial growth.

We’ve all made mistakes when we’re first starting out with investing—and that’s okay. In fact, it’s part of the process. When my son began investing as a teenager, he made all the classic rookie moves. He chased hype stocks without understanding the companies behind them, racked up unnecessary fees by trading too often, and panicked during market downturns. At times, he let emotions take the wheel instead of sticking to a solid strategy.

But every mistake was a lesson in disguise. He didn’t give up—he leaned in. He kept learning, kept reading, kept asking questions. Over time, he became more thoughtful, more disciplined, and more strategic in his approach. Now? He’s a beast. He’s not just growing his own portfolio—he’s giving me suggestions that are smart, researched, and insightful.

That’s the power of starting young and staying committed to growth. You don’t have to be perfect—you just have to be willing to learn and keep going. The earlier you start, the more time you have to turn lessons into wins.

View each investment decision as a learning opportunity rather than simply a financial transaction. Keep a journal documenting your investment rationale, expectations, and subsequent outcomes. This practice accelerates your development as an investor and helps identify patterns in your decision-making.

### Patience: The Investor’s Superpower

In a world of fast food, fast fashion, and viral moments, patience can feel outdated. But when it comes to building real wealth, patience isn’t just a virtue—it’s a superpower. Patience applies both to allowing your investments time to grow and to waiting for appropriate opportunities. Sometimes the best investment decision is no decision at all—maintaining your current strategy and avoiding unnecessary changes.

The market will have highs and lows, trends will come and go, but disciplined, long-term investors are the ones who win in the end. Remember, your money needs time to grow. The earlier you start and the more consistent you are, the more powerful your results will be.

The Bible says in Galatians 6:9, “Let us not grow weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.” That applies to your money too. Investing isn’t about getting rich overnight—it’s about planting seeds and letting time do its work.

### Contrarian Thinking: Find the Gold Where No One’s Looking

Here’s a secret most people won’t tell you: the best money moves aren’t always trending on TikTok or hyped up in your group chat. In my experience, the moments I blindly followed hype or so-called experts were the moments I lost the most money. Real investing success comes from doing your own research, trusting the data, and staying grounded in fundamentals—not noise. I always do your own research, trust the process, and invest with intention—not impulse.

Some of the smartest investors like Warren Buffett, made their money by doing the opposite of what everyone else was doing. That’s called contrarian thinking. It means trusting your own research and instincts, especially when the crowd is distracted by hype.

While everyone was chasing flashy tech stocks and jumping on meme stocks like GameStop and AMC, I was looking at “boring” companies—like those that make toothpaste, laundry detergent, and snacks. Not exciting, right? But those so-called boring companies were stable, affordable, and still making money when everything else was crashing.

Being different can feel risky, but in investing, it can also be your biggest advantage. Don’t just follow the crowd—learn to see value where others aren’t even looking. That’s how real wealth is built.

### Real Talk: You Don’t Have to Be a Stock Market Genius to Build Wealth

Let me keep it 100 with you: most of the people out here claiming to be “professional investors” are just middlemen, trying to make money off you. They dress it up with big words and fancy charts, but many are just taking fees while pretending they can beat the market.

Let me share something with you that many so-called experts won’t; simply because they don’t get paid to tell the truth: you don’t need to be an expert to invest wisely. You don’t need to time the market, pick the next hot stock, or pay someone big fees to do it for you.

What you do need is a simple, smart strategy: invest consistently in a low-cost index fund, and leave it alone. That’s it. That’s the real cheat code. Over time, that simple move can outperform the majority of these so-called “experts.” And guess what? You’ll keep more of your money, because you’re not paying high fees to people selling you dreams.

The earlier you start, the more your money grows—not because you’re doing anything wild, but because time and consistency are your superpowers.

You don’t need to be flashy to build wealth. You just need to be wise, patient, and intentional.

Let everyone else chase hype. You? You’re securing the bag—with strategy. You’re welcome:)

## Implementation: Your 30-Day Investment Launch Plan

Knowledge without action produces no results. The following 30-day plan provides a structured approach to beginning your investment journey if and when you’re ready:

**Days 1-5: Research and Account Setup** - Discuss investment accounts with parents/guardians - Select appropriate account type (custodial brokerage, Roth IRA, etc.) - Research investment platforms and compare features - Complete account application with custodian - Link bank account for transfers

**Days 6-10: Education and Strategy Development** - Determine initial asset allocation based on goals and risk tolerance - Research potential index funds or ETFs for core portfolio - Identify 2-3 individual companies for potential investment (if individual stocks are part of your strategy) - Document your investment philosophy and decision-making process - Establish specific investment goals with timeframes

**Days 11-15: Initial Investments** - Make first investment contribution - Purchase core positions according to your asset allocation - Set up automatic investment schedule if platform allows - Establish dividend reinvestment settings - Create portfolio tracking system (spreadsheet or app)

**Days 16-30: Routine Development and Continued Learning** - Schedule regular portfolio review dates (monthly or quarterly) - Identify reliable information sources for ongoing education - Join investment communities appropriate for young investors - Establish savings plan to fund future investments - Share your investment journey with trusted friends or family members

This structured approach transforms investing from an intimidating concept into a concrete series of manageable steps. Each action builds confidence for the next, creating momentum that carries forward into lifelong investing habits.

### The Journey Ahead

Your investment journey begins during your teenage years, but it extends throughout your lifetime. The knowledge, habits, and perspective you develop now will influence decades of financial decisions and ultimately determine your level of financial freedom.

Beyond the potential for wealth creation, investing connects you to the broader economy and deepens your understanding of business, technology, and global development. The skills you develop as an investor—analytical thinking, emotional discipline, and long-term planning—provide advantages in countless other areas of life.

Remember that investment mastery develops through experience, not immediate perfection. Every successful investor began as a beginner, made mistakes, adjusted their approach, and continued learning. The fact that you’re starting this journey during your teenage years already places you ahead of the vast majority of your peers.

The French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal noted that “small minds are concerned with the extraordinary, great minds with the ordinary.” In investing, extraordinary results typically come not from spectacular or unusual strategies but from the consistent application of fundamental principles over extended periods. The seemingly ordinary habits—regular investing, proper diversification, emotional discipline, and continuous learning—ultimately produce extraordinary outcomes.

**Bag Builder Tip:** Build your wealth like you build muscle—through steady reps. Consistency in smart, simple investing beats flashy moves every time. ~Dee Martine

Your most valuable asset isn’t your current financial resources but your youth itself—the time for your investments to grow and compound. This advantage, once lost, can never be recovered. By beginning your investment journey today, you’re making a profound commitment to your future self, one that will reshape the entire trajectory of your financial life.

Investment isn’t merely about accumulating money; it’s about creating options and opportunities. The freedom to pursue meaningful work, support causes you value, provide for loved ones, and ultimately live life on your own terms. The decisions you make now are the first steps toward that future. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Your investment journey starts today.

Let me leave you with the single most important principle that’s guided and shaped my entire journey and has shaped everything for me. I hope you carry with you:

You will grow in the direction of the people around you. If you’re always in rooms where you’re the smartest, most focused, or most driven person—you’re in the wrong rooms. Instead, find people who push you to be sharper, kinder, more disciplined, and more visionary. People who challenge you to level up just by how they live. ~Dee Martine

I’ve been fortunate to learn from teachers, friends, and mentors who were ahead of me in mindset and character. I paid attention. I listened. I learned. And because of that, my life took a better path.

Success is rarely a solo journey. So here’s my advice to you: - Put God first and foremost in everything. He guide your path and purpose. - Don’t be the smartest one at the table. Surround yourself with people who uplift and challenge you. - Change your mindset. Believe in abundance, not scarcity.

The people you spend time with influence who you become. Choose to be around those who uplift you, push you to grow, and genuinely believe in your potential. - Pick friends who study harder, dream bigger, and walk with integrity. - Seek mentors and role models who inspire you with their actions and wisdom. - When it’s time to think about love and marriage, choose peace over chaos and purpose over distractions. - Your future spouse is one of the most important decisions in your life. They will impact every aspect of your journey—emotionally, financially, and spiritually. Take your time.

Remember, abundance is your birthright. There’s no guilt in pursuing it—only gratitude.

Lastly, your network is your net worth.

As we come to the close of Secure the Bag: Things That Should’ve Been Taught in Schools, I want to take a moment and reflect on why this book exists. This wasn’t just a good idea—it was a calling. It was birthed from the questions of my students/tutees and mentees, many of whom were seniors on the brink of adulthood. Bright, capable, and full of promise, yet lacking the financial knowledge they desperately need to navigate the world as adults. They weren’t just curious—they were hungry to learn. They asked the right questions, demanded better answers, and ultimately, their curiosity and hunger for knowledge inspired me to write this book. They challenged me, not only to provide the information they were missing but to ensure that future generations wouldn’t face the same gap in their financial education. I wanted them to have the tools, the mindset, and the confidence to not just survive—but thrive.

This journey has been deeply personal. My life’s purpose has always been to uplift the youth. From 7 days a week tutoring, to organizing college tours for students who had never stepped foot on a campus, to writing and publishing an SAT prep book for those who couldn’t afford overpriced prep classes—this has always been the mission. Mentoring. Guiding. Exposing young people to what’s possible and reminding them that their dreams are valid. This book is just another chapter in that mission, another tool in their hands to help them build a future filled with opportunity, power, and purpose.

Financial literacy shouldn’t be an afterthought. Financial literacy should never be a luxury. It should be part of the foundation of our educational system. Our youth are transitioning into adulthood, expected to step into the real world with dreams, ambition, and potential—but without the financial knowledge to sustain it. That’s not just unfair—it’s unacceptable. Secure the Bag exists to help close that gap. To say: You deserve to know how money works. You deserve to walk into adulthood with confidence, clarity, and control over your choices. My hope is that this book becomes your guide, your mirror, and your launchpad.

## Reflection

In these pages, I’ve poured everything I wish someone had told me sooner. My hope is that you walk away not just knowing how to manage money, but understanding that true wealth lies in freedom—freedom to choose your path, to walk away from what no longer serves you, and to live a life that aligns with who you are and what you believe. Financial freedom is The Gift, and the ability to build a secure, purposeful future is The Prize. You’ve got time on your side—use it like the precious resource it is. How you spend, save, and steward it will define your journey.

Let me be crystal clear: none of this would be possible without God. His fingerprints are all over this work. Every word, every insight, every lesson in this book has been guided by His wisdom and grace. When I felt tired, He gave me strength. When I doubted, He gave me clarity. So let Rule #1 forever stands: In everything that you do, Put God first. When He is at the center of your life and your decisions, everything else finds its rightful place. I know this firsthand. God didn’t just call you to success—He called you to purpose. And in that purpose, you’ll find provision, strategy, and yes, above all peace.

Lastly, as you begin to build wealth, I want you to remember something vital: being a millionaire is not the goal. Neither is being a billionaire. The world might try to sell you that dream, but real success is being financially free—free to glorify God with your life, free to bless others, and free to walk boldly in your calling. That kind of freedom can’t be measured in dollars, but in impact. That kind of freedom brings a contentment money can never buy.

Thank you for walking this path with me. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your journey. This book exists because of God’s grace and guidance, and it’s my prayer that it serves its purpose in your life. Thank you for choosing to take control of your future. I hope this book becomes a guide you return to, a spark that ignites something powerful in you.

Thank you for being a part of this movement. Now, go ahead—secure your bag, not for the hype, but for the healing, for the freedom, and for the future God has called you to create.

“But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.” — Matthew 6:33

## Final Challenge: Secure the Bag IRL (In Real Life)

You’ve read the lessons. You’ve reflected. Hopefully by now you are feeling inspired and grounded. Now it’s time to move differently. Wealth doesn’t build itself—you have to take the first step. This final challenge is designed to help you turn knowledge into action.

### Step 1: Set Your First Money Goal

Write down one short-term and one long-term money goal.

**Examples:** - **Short-term:** Save $100 in 3 months, open a teen savings account, or create a $25/month investing plan. - **Long-term:** Buy your first stock, start a Roth IRA, build a $1,000 emergency fund, or save for your first car.

### Step 2: Choose Your Bag Strategy

Pick ONE strategy you learned in this book to help you reach your goal: - Budgeting using the 50/30/20 rule - Investing with ETFs or individual stocks - Creating a side hustle - Cutting hype spending and tracking your habits - Opening your first account (bank, brokerage, or Roth IRA)

### Step 3: Track the Bag

Use a “Bag Tracker worksheet” to check in weekly. Note what you earned, saved, or invested—and how close you’re getting to your goal. (Start where you are. $5 counts.)

### Step 4: Teach One, Reach One

Share ONE money lesson you learned from this book with a friend, sibling, or parent. Real wealth isn’t just about how much you make—it’s how much you pass on.

### Step 5: Celebrate Your Wins

Big or small—celebrate. Whether you downloaded your first investing app, saved your first $50, or just finally understand how money works… that’s a win. Keep that same energy.

**Reminder:** The bag isn’t just about money—it’s about freedom, choices, and showing up for your future self. Keep going. Keep growing. And remember: you don’t need a lot to start, but you do need to start.

## Final Reflection

Hopefully by now you are feeling inspired and grounded:

**“What does securing the bag mean to you now?”**

After everything you’ve learned—about budgeting, saving, investing, mindset, habits, and legacy—how has your view of money changed?

*   What does financial freedom look like for you?
*   What are you most excited to do with your money in the future?
*   What habits will you keep, and what will you leave behind?
*   Who do you want to help or inspire with your financial knowledge?

Take a moment to write it out. This is your blueprint. Your reminder. Your personal definition of the bag. Keep it close—and come back to it whenever you need to realign with your goals.

**The real flex isn’t just having money—it’s having purpose, peace, and power with it.**
