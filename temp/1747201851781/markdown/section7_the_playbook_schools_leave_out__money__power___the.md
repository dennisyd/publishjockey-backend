# The Playbook Schools Leave Out: Money, Power & The System

Let’s get real. Money runs the world. It’s not just paper or numbers in an account—it’s power, freedom, and choices. The sooner you understand that, the sooner you can take control of your future instead of letting the system control you.

Here’s the real issue: Most schools don’t teach you how money actually works. Sure, you’ll learn how to solve for x (which matters), dissect a frog, or memorize key dates in history. But when it comes to making, managing, and multiplying money in real life? Crickets. No lessons on credit, no tips on building wealth, and definitely no breakdown of your first paycheck. And it makes you wonder… is that by accident, or by design?

As a mathematician, I can tell you—yes, math matters. And yes, your GPA matters. But just as critical is understanding how money moves, grows, and works in real life. That math directly impacts your wellbeing, your freedom, and your future. Financial literacy deserves just as much attention as any academic subject you’ll ever study.

“Financial literacy is like math: when you understand the formula, you can solve for freedom.”

— M Dee

That’s exactly why this chapter exists. Just like I prepare my two sons for a secure financial future, I refuse to let this generation step into adulthood unprepared. They deserve the tools to build, manage, and own their wealth with confidence. — Dee Martine

By the time you finish this, you’ll understand: - Why money = power and how to make it work for you instead of against you - How the financial system is designed—and how to navigate it like a pro - The foundational money moves you need to master before you even think about building wealth

This education will flip the script on your future, if you let it. Truly life changing.

**Bag Builder Tip #9:** Generational wealth can start with you. You might not come from money, but you can make sure money comes from you. Build a plan, stick to it, and watch how your choices change your future. #SecureTheBag

## Making the Connection: Math & Money Are More Related Than You Think

You’ve all spent years learning about negative numbers—but have you made the connection? A negative balance in your bank account means you spent more than you had and now owe money. You solve for “x” in algebra—well, balancing your bank account is just another real-life equation. This is hands-on math. Financial literacy isn’t separate from other school subjects; it’s just that sometimes the connection wasn’t made. It’s the missing link that makes those lessons matter in real life.

That’s why I started personal bank accounts for my boys when they were around eight years old. They had to log in, check their balances, and track their deposits and withdrawals. Sometimes, they’d even catch mistakes.

### Real-Life Banking Lesson: Always Pay Attention

Yance learned a tough but important lesson on his birthday. He deposited twenty-five $20 bills—a total of $500—from gifts given by family and friends into a well-known bank. As he left, he checked his receipt and saw the teller had only credited him for 15 of the bills ($300) instead of $500. Luckily, he caught the mistake immediately and asked for the amount to be corrected. This is the importance of paying attention to your money. People make mistakes—including cashiers and bankers—but if you don’t check, you could lose out on what’s rightfully yours.

Fraud, errors, and financial mishaps happen all the time. If you don’t take control of your money, someone else will—and that’s the bottom line.

## Mastering the Banking System: From Your First Account to Avoiding Hidden Fees

Picture this: You’ve just landed your first part-time job, and that initial paycheck is burning a hole in your pocket. But before you start dreaming about all the things you could buy, let’s talk about something that might sound boring but is actually your secret weapon to financial freedom - smart banking.

Trust me when I tell you that choosing the right place to keep your hard-earned cash is just as important as earning it in the first place. Think of it as choosing the perfect home for your money. You want it to be safe, comfortable, and working in your favor, not against you.

Walking into a bank (or opening an account online) might seem like a basic step, but understanding how banks work—and how they make money off you—can save you thousands over time. If you don’t know the game, you could be paying unnecessary fees, losing money on bad interest rates, or missing out on ways to make your money grow.

### Choosing the Right Bank for You: Finding Your Financial Home

Let’s start with a question that might be on your mind: What’s the difference between a bank and a credit union, and why should you care? Not all banks are created equal. Some are designed to serve you, while others are designed to squeeze every penny they can out of you. When picking a bank, consider the following:

*   **Traditional Banks vs. Online Banks** - Traditional banks have physical locations but often come with higher fees. Online banks typically offer higher interest rates on savings and lower fees because they don’t have the overhead costs of brick-and-mortar locations.
*   **Credit Unions** - These are nonprofit institutions that often offer better interest rates and fewer fees than big banks. If you’re eligible to join one, it’s worth considering.

#### Banks: The Big Players

Banks are like the Netflix of the financial world - they’re everywhere, they’re convenient, and they offer a wide range of services. Here’s what makes them shine:

**Pros:** - Widespread ATM and branch networks (perfect for when you’re traveling) - Cutting-edge mobile apps and online banking platforms - Extensive product offerings, from basic checking accounts to investment options - Usually first to roll out new banking technologies

But like anything else, banks have their drawbacks:

**Cons:** - Generally higher fees for services (average monthly maintenance fees range from $10-15) - Profit-driven decisions that might not always benefit you - Higher overdraft fees (averaging $35 per incident) - Longer hold times for deposited checks - Higher minimum balance requirements for premium services

#### Credit Unions: The Community Champions

Now, let’s talk about credit unions. These not-for-profit organizations are owned by their members—that’s you when you join! They come with their own set of perks:

**Pros:** - Lower fees and better interest rates on savings - More forgiving policies on overdrafts and minimum balances - Personalized service where you’re treated like a person, not a number - Member-focused decision making

But they’re not perfect either:

**Cons:** - Fewer branches and ATMs - Sometimes slower to adopt new technologies - Limited product offerings - Membership requirements (though these are usually easy to meet)

### Understanding Fees—So You Don’t Get Played

Banks make billions every year from fees that eat into your money. Nothing kills your financial momentum faster than unnecessary fees. Look for accounts with low or no fees and always read the fine print. Here’s what to watch out for:

*   **Overdraft Fees** - If you spend more than what’s in your account, banks will often cover the difference and charge you $30-$35 per overdraft. Some banks offer overdraft protection—sign up for it!
*   **Monthly Maintenance Fees** - Some banks charge you just to keep an account open. Many will waive this if you set up direct deposit or maintain a minimum balance.
*   **ATM Fees** - Using an out-of-network ATM can cost you $3-$5 per withdrawal. Find a bank with fee-free ATMs or reimbursement policies.
*   **Wire Transfer Fees** - If you ever need to send money, banks charge high fees for wire transfers. Apps like Zelle, Venmo, or Cash App are often better alternatives.

### Understanding Interest Rates—The Key to Growing (or Losing) Money

*   **Savings Account Interest** - A high-yield savings account (HYSA) will grow your money over time. Look for online banks offering 4% APY or more instead of big banks that pay close to 0%.
*   **Checking Account Interest** - Most checking accounts don’t pay interest. If they do, check for hidden fees that cancel out any earnings.
*   **Credit Card Interest (APR)** - If you carry a balance on a credit card, expect interest rates between 15-30%. This is how banks make serious money off people who don’t pay their balances in full each month.

## Managing Your Money Like a Pro

Now that you know where to keep your money, let’s talk about how to manage it effectively. This is where the rubber meets the road - where good intentions turn into smart habits.

### Checking Accounts: Your Money’s Command Center

Think of your checking account as your money’s living room - it’s where most of the action happens. A checking account is a type of bank account designed for frequent transactions, offering easy access to your money through various methods including debit cards, checks, ATMs, and electronic transfers.

#### Understanding Different Types of Checking Accounts

Student Checking, Basic Checking, and Premium Checking with better interest rates but requiring a larger minimum balance. I would recommend student or basic:

**Student Checking Account** - Usually available for ages 13-24 - Often has no minimum balance requirements - May offer fee waivers for 4-5 years - Comes with a free debit card - Limited overdraft options

**Basic Checking Account** - Minimal features but lower fees - Usually includes online banking - Standard debit card access - Basic mobile banking features

#### Make Your Checking Account Work for You:

**Choose the Right Account:** Ask these questions before opening an account: - Are there any monthly maintenance fees? - Is there a minimum balance requirement? (Some banks charge fees if your balance drops too low.) - What’s the interest rate on savings? (Higher is better—your money should be making money.) - Do you offer free ATM access? (Out-of-network ATM fees can add up fast.) - What’s the minimum balance to avoid fees? - What fees are associated with this account? - Overdraft protection options? - Are there age-related benefits? - How long are holds on deposited checks? - Is there a limit on mobile deposits? - What’s the ATM withdrawal limit?

## Making Your Money Work for You: Understanding Savings Accounts & Investment Options

When you put money in the bank, it shouldn’t just sit there collecting dust—it should be working for you, and by that I mean growing. The right savings account can help your money grow while keeping it safe. But not all savings accounts are created equal, and understanding the differences can mean the difference between barely earning anything and watching your money multiply over time.

There are a few main types of savings accounts:

### Basic Savings Accounts

These are the most common but offer the lowest interest rates—often as little as 0.01% in major banks. While they keep your money safe and easily accessible, they don’t help it grow much. They’re fine for emergency savings or short-term goals but not for wealth-building. You will never be rich keeping all your money in a conventional bank. I personally keep a few thousand dollars for emergencies and pay monthly bills.

### High-Yield Savings Accounts

These accounts offer higher interest rates (often 10x or more than regular savings accounts—and yes, you heard right, 10x) and are usually found at online banks. I personally prefer these over the big-name banks because even if I don’t need the money, I like knowing it’s accessible while still earning a solid return.

### Money Market Accounts

These are a mix between a savings and a checking account, often come with limited monthly withdrawals and offer slightly higher interest rates than a basic savings account, but they require a higher minimum balance. This is a good option for those who want to earn more on their savings while maintaining accessibility. They’re great if you want some flexibility while still growing your savings.

Money market funds, however, are entirely different from Money market accounts. These are investment vehicles that pool capital to invest in short-term, low-risk debt securities such as Treasury bills, certificates of deposit (CDs), and commercial paper. Unlike money market accounts, money market funds are not FDIC-insured, meaning they carry some level of risk. While they often provide better returns than a standard savings account, they are still subject to market fluctuations and should be considered within a diversified portfolio.

### Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

CDs lock your money away for a set period (like 6 months, 1 year, or 5 years) in exchange for a higher interest rate. For example, when my boys were younger, I opened CDs for them at a 5% annual rate. That was much higher than what a regular bank offered, but the trade-off was that the money wasn’t accessible without paying a penalty for early withdrawal. That’s why I personally prefer high-yield savings accounts—you still get a good interest rate, but the money is available if needed.

### Mutual Funds & Bonds

Once you’ve built up your savings, you can explore investment options that offer even better long-term growth. Mutual funds pool money from different investors to buy a mix of stocks and bonds, helping you grow your money without putting all your eggs in one basket. Bonds, on the other hand, are like loans you give to companies or the government—they pay you back with interest over time.

The bottom line? Let your money work for you. Whether it’s a high-yield savings account, a CD, or a well-chosen investment, you want your savings to grow—not sit idle earning 0.01% in a big-name bank. The more you understand how to make money work, the less you’ll have to work for money later.

## Looking Ahead

Choosing the right bank is one of the first smart financial moves you’ll make. Get it right, and you’ll set yourself up for saving and growing your money the right way from day one. Banking smart isn’t just about avoiding fees and managing accounts - it’s about building a foundation for your financial future. The habits you develop now will serve you well as you move on to more complex financial decisions like credit cards, loans, and investments.

Remember, the best banking setup is the one that fits your life and helps you reach your goals. Don’t be afraid to change banks or adjust your strategy as your needs evolve. Your money should work as hard as you do, and smart banking is how you make that happen.

Remember, your relationship with money is a journey, not a destination. Start building these smart banking habits now, and you’ll thank yourself later. Your future self is counting on you to make wise choices today.

## Breaking the Cycle: How You Can Build Wealth No Matter Where You Start

Let’s be real—not everyone starts from the same place. Some people are born into wealth, with families who teach them how to invest, save, and build financial security from an early age. Others grow up watching their parents struggle, living paycheck to paycheck, or navigating a system that seems designed to keep them behind.

But remember: where you start does not determine where you end up.

### The Wealth Gap Is Real—But It’s Not a Life Sentence

Generational wealth is one of the biggest factors in determining who has financial security and who struggles to stay afloat. If your parents or grandparents didn’t have assets to pass down—whether property, investments, or even financial knowledge—it might feel like you’re already behind. But here’s the truth: wealth isn’t just something you inherit; it’s something you build. And the good news? You have the power to change the trajectory of your financial future.

My purpose is clear—I want to equip you with the knowledge and strategies to take control of your finances and create lasting wealth. Money isn’t just about earning; it’s about making intentional moves, understanding how it works, and using it as a tool to unlock opportunities. I firmly believe that anyone, no matter where they start, can build wealth with diligence, discipline, and self-education.

I wasn’t taught this in school. I had to seek out the knowledge, read, research, and apply what I learned. And now, I’m giving you the blueprint. Because once you understand the game, you can play to win—and when you win financially, you create freedom, power, and options for yourself and future generations.

### Shift Your Mindset—You Are Not Stuck

What if I told you that your bank account reflects not just how much you earn or spend, but your deepest beliefs about money—many of which you don’t even realize you have.

Sounds crazy, right? After all, who doesn’t want more money? More freedom? More opportunities? But here’s the truth: our money beliefs are deeply embedded in our subconscious. The thing is, and I know this firsthand—wanting wealth and being mentally ready to receive it are two different things.

Wealth-building starts with belief. If you constantly tell yourself, “I’ll never be rich” or “Money isn’t for people like me,” you’re creating a mindset that keeps you stuck. The truth is, your financial situation is only permanent if you decide it is. The first step to changing your reality is believing that change is possible.

Anyone who knows me will tell you—Martine believes anything is achievable. I live by the principle that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. I know that I can have anything I desire because I refuse to limit myself. And the more I believe it, the more it becomes my reality. Faith, mindset, and action work together to turn dreams into tangible success.

Start asking yourself: - How can I earn more? - How can I make my money work for me? - What habits are keeping me from building wealth?

### Master the Basics

You don’t have to be a millionaire to make smart financial moves. Even if you’re starting with nothing, you can: - Budget wisely—Track your money so you control it, not the other way around. - Build an emergency fund—Even $10 at a time can grow into something big. - Pay yourself first—Before spending, save a portion of your income, no matter how small. You deserve it.

### Make Your Money Work for You

Saving money is important, but if you think parking all your cash in a traditional savings account is the best move, think again. While keeping money in a bank is safer than hiding it under your mattress, most traditional banks offer incredibly low interest rates—so low that your money barely grows over time. Let me give you a real example: I once had a few thousand dollars sitting in a bank account for months. When I checked my earnings, I had made a grand total of… $0.15 in interest. Yes, you read that right—fifteen cents. That’s not growth; that’s stagnation.

#### Why a Traditional Savings Account Isn’t Enough

Most big banks offer a tiny interest rate on savings accounts—sometimes as low as 0.01% APY (Annual Percentage Yield). This means for every $1,000 you save, you might earn a few cents in a whole year. Meanwhile, inflation—how prices rise over time—reduces the value of your money. If you’re earning next to nothing on your savings, but the price of everything is going up, your money is actually losing value.

#### What Should You Do Instead?

If you’re not ready to invest just yet, the next best thing is shopping for the highest interest rate on a savings account. Online banks and credit unions often offer much higher interest rates—sometimes 4% or more. That means your money is at least growing while you figure out your next financial move.

**Steps to Find the Best Savings Account:** 1. Compare interest rates - Look for a high-yield savings account with at least 3-4% APY. 2. Check the fees - Avoid accounts that charge monthly maintenance fees. 3. Look for easy access - Make sure you can access your money when you need it. 4. Read reviews - Choose a bank that has great customer service and strong security.

#### The Bottom Line

Saving alone won’t build wealth—investing will. Leaving all your money in a traditional savings account means it’s just sitting there, barely growing. Instead, be smart about where you save—find a high-yield savings account so your money earns real interest. The earlier you start, the better. Whether it’s stocks, real estate, or a side hustle that generates passive income, the key to financial freedom is creating multiple streams of income so you’re never reliant on just one paycheck.

**Bag Builder Tip #11:** “Money that sits grows. Money that slips goes.” — Secure the Bag

In later chapters, we’ll dive deep into the world of investing—because the majority of this book is dedicated to teaching you how to make your money grow. We’ll break down everything from the stock market and real estate to business ventures and building passive income. The goal isn’t just to save—it’s to multiply your wealth and create lasting financial security.

### Break the Cycle for the Next Generation

Once you begin building wealth, pass that knowledge along. Teach your younger siblings, your future kids, friends, or even your students—whether it’s during lunch or before class. Breaking the cycle isn’t just about you; it’s about ensuring the next generation doesn’t have to start from scratch. That’s my passion, my calling. Each one, teach one… my favorite African proverb!

## Final Thoughts

As a math educator and a math analyst, I always communicate to my students the importance of bringing math to life. Inarguably, the best lessons I’ve taught have been solving equations, relating them to the real world, and the chapter on interest rates—simple and compound. Whether you’re buying a car, a mortgage, a student loan, or opening an account and investing in stocks… it covers it all. That’s real life. It can’t get more real-world than this.

No matter where you start, you have the power to create a different financial future. It won’t happen overnight, but every smart decision you make today is a step toward financial freedom, security, and generational wealth.

Generational wealth can start with you. You might not come from money, but you can make sure money comes from you. Build a plan, stick to it, and watch how your choices change your future.
