# Note from the Author to Parents: Bonus Tips

## Raising Future Secure

The greatest gift we as parents can give our children isn’t just money - it’s the knowledge and mindset to create and maintain wealth throughout their lives. As I’ve worked with thousands of families and students over the past two decades, I’ve observed a clear pattern: children who develop healthy money habits early become adults who build lasting wealth. This isn’t about turning your child into a money-obsessed robot; it’s about instilling the values, knowledge, and skills that will help them achieve financial freedom.

### The Million-Dollar Mindset Starts at Home

Picture this: Your ten-year-old son comes home from school, excited about a new video game all his friends are playing. Instead of immediately saying yes or no, you turn this into a teaching moment. “How much does it cost? How long would it take to save for it? Could that money grow if we invested it instead?” This simple conversation plants the seeds of financial literacy that will bloom into wealth-building habits.

The truth is, most schools still don’t teach real financial literacy—and when they do, it’s often reduced to a graded assignment. But financial freedom isn’t something you should memorize for a test and forget after the semester is over. It’s a life skill. Once we attach grades to anything, we risk stripping away the essence of the lesson. Students tend to focus more on getting an “A” than on truly understanding how the lesson applies to real life. When performance takes priority over purpose, true understanding takes a backseat.

Financial literacy is not just another school subject—it’s a lifelong skill. It’s about helping your child build confidence, independence, and a sense of control over their future. I believe students should be assessed by how they apply what they learn, not just how well they memorize facts.

This book is not about adding pressure—it’s about planting seeds and strategies that stick with you long after school is over. My hope is that it sparks honest conversations in your home, gives your teen practical tools, and empowers them to make wise choices now and for years to come. Financial education isn’t extra—it’s essential.

## Millionaire Moves: 5 Stock Investment Strategies Parents Can Start at Birth to Build Lifelong Wealth for Your Child

These strategies assume consistent, long-term investments with a focus on the power of compound interest and time, assuming a 10% annual average return.

### 1\. Invest $25/month from birth to age 21 in an S&P 500 Index Fund

If you consistently invest just $25/month from birth to age 21 in an S&P 500 Index Fund—and never add another dollar after that—here’s how your money could grow over time:

*   Your Total Contribution: $6,300
*   Value by Age 21: $21,463
*   By Age 30: $50,610
*   By Age 45: $211,411
*   By Age 55: $548,346
*   By Age 65: $1,422,268

### 2\. Invest $50/month from birth to age 21 in an S&P 500 Index Fund

If you consistently invest just $50/month from birth to age 21 in an S&P 500 Index Fund—and never add another dollar after that—here’s how your money could grow over time assuming a 10% average annual return:

*   Your Total Contribution: $12,600
*   Value by Age 21: $42,927
*   By Age 30: $101,220
*   By Age 45: $422,822
*   By Age 55: $1,096,692
*   By Age 65: $2,844,536

### 3\. $50/month in a Dividend Growth ETF (like SCHD or VIG)

*   Invest consistently in high-quality dividend-paying companies.
*   Reinvest dividends to fuel compound growth—“money that pays you.”
*   By age 30, this could grow to $120,000+.

### 4\. “Birthday Stock Gifting” - $500 every birthday

*   Skip the toys—gift stocks instead.
*   $500/year invested for 18 years = $9,000 total contribution. With a 10% average return, this could grow to:
    *   By age 18: $28,000+
    *   By age 40: $180,000+ if left to grow.

### 5\. Investing $100/month for your child from birth

*   Total Contribution over 18 years = $21,600.
*   At a 10% average annual growth, this could grow to:
    *   By age 18: $70,000+
    *   By age 25: $120,000+ (will be set after college)
    *   By age 30: $200,000+
    *   By Age 40: $637,000 (That’s over half a million dollars)

The key takeaway is simple: start investing as early as possible, and choose what fits your budget. It could be as little as $5 a month, but don’t wait any longer to begin. The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow. I wish I had started when my boys were younger but it is never too late… And don’t forget about your own future—investing for your retirement is just as important. Every little bit you put away now can make a huge difference down the road. Start today and let the power of compound growth work for you.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Start Investing for Your Child (with Suggestions)

### Step 1: Decide Where to Open the Account

You’ll need to choose the right type of account to start investing. Here are some options:

#### Custodial Accounts (UGMA/UTMA)

*   **What is it?**: These accounts allow you to manage the investment until your child reaches the legal age (usually 18 or 21), at which point the child takes control.
*   **Recommended platforms**:
    *   **Fidelity**: Offers easy-to-use custodial accounts with no account fees. Great for beginners.
    *   **Charles Schwab**: Another good option for custodial accounts, known for its low-cost investment options.

#### 529 College Savings Plan

*   **What is it?** A tax-advantaged account for saving for your child’s education. Contributions grow tax-free as long as they’re used for educational purposes.
*   **Recommended platforms**:
    *   **Vanguard 529 Plan**: Low fees and solid investment choices for education savings.
    *   **Fidelity 529 College Savings Plan**: A kid-friendly, well-structured plan with easy online access.

#### Roth IRA for Kids

*   **What is it?** If your child has earned income (like from a job), you can open a Roth IRA. Contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals after age 59½ are tax-free.
*   **Why it’s great**: A Roth IRA is a favorite because the earlier you start, the more your money can grow over time thanks to compound interest.
*   **Recommended platforms**:
    *   **Fidelity**: Known for offering no minimum investment for Roth IRAs and low fees. It’s also very user-friendly, especially for beginners.
    *   **Charles Schwab**: Also offers Roth IRA accounts with easy access and educational resources for both you and your child.

### Step 2: Fund the Account

Once the account is open, it’s time to fund it. Here’s how:

*   **Lump-Sum Deposit**: You can start with a one-time deposit of $500 or any amount you’re comfortable with.
*   **Monthly Contributions**: Setting up automatic monthly contributions (e.g., $20 or $50/month) is a great way to make investing a habit. It’s like paying yourself first!
*   **Platforms to use**:
    *   Fidelity and Vanguard both allow easy automatic monthly contributions, which you can set up when you open the account.

### Step 3: Choose Investments

Now that you have your account, it’s time to choose where to invest the money. Here are some beginner-friendly options:

#### Index Funds

*   **Why it’s great**: Index funds spread your money across many different stocks, which reduces risk and helps grow your investment over time.
*   **Suggested Funds**:
    *   **Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)**: A solid option that tracks the entire U.S. stock market.
    *   **Fidelity ZERO Total Market Index Fund (FZROX)**: A great low-fee alternative that tracks the entire U.S. stock market.

#### ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)

*   **Why it’s great**: ETFs are similar to index funds, but you can buy and sell them just like individual stocks.
*   **Suggested ETFs**:
    *   **SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**: A very popular ETF that tracks the top 500 companies in the U.S.
    *   **Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)**: A good option for long-term growth.

#### Target-Date Funds

*   **Why it’s great**: These funds automatically adjust their investments as your child gets older, making them a very simple and hands-off option.
*   **Suggested Funds**:
    *   **Fidelity Freedom Index Funds**: These are simple, diversified funds that automatically adjust for risk over time.
    *   **Vanguard Target Retirement Funds**: Another great option for parents who want a set-it-and-forget-it approach to investing.

### Step 4: Track the Investment

Since this is a long term investment, you don’t need to check every day, but you should check the account at least once a year to see how it’s performing. You can easily monitor your child’s investments on the platform’s website or app. Some platforms, like Fidelity and Charles Schwab, even offer educational tools to help you understand how the account is growing.

### Step 5: Watch it Grow

The most important thing is patience. Over time, your child’s money will grow through compound interest—the “magic” of earning money on your money. Starting early gives you a head start, and the earlier you start, the more powerful this growth will be.

### Quick Recap:

1.  **Choose the account**: Open a custodial account (UGMA/UTMA), a 529 plan, or a Roth IRA for your child. Try Fidelity or Charles Schwab.
2.  **Fund it**: Add money to the account, either as a lump sum or with monthly contributions.
3.  **Choose investments**: Start with index funds or ETFs, like VUG, VOO, VTI for beginner-friendly options.
4.  **Track it**: Monitor the account at least once a year.
5.  **Let it grow**: Be patient and let compound interest work its magic!

And just like that, you’re on your way to building financial freedom for your child’s future. Congratulations!

### Choose Your Investments

*   Go to the “Quotes” section and start investing in assets.

*   Avoid penny stocks, meme stocks, IPOs, and cryptocurrencies—they’re too risky and volatile at this stage.

### Max Out Contributions

*   In 2025, you can contribute up to $7,000 if you’re under 50, or $8,000 if you’re older.
*   If you max out your Roth IRA contributions for 20 years, you’ll have about $457,000 by retirement, with an average return.
