# Level Up Your Bag: The Final Game Plan

Your first order of business is to open an account. Fidelity is a solid choice for teens because it offers a free Youth Account for ages 13-17 with no fees, no minimum balance, and real access to invest in stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds—with a parent or guardian’s permission. Plus, the platform is easy to use, and you get to start learning how to invest early with tools made just for you.

## Step-by-Step Guide on How to Open a Fidelity Investment Account

### Step 1: Go to Fidelity’s Website

*   Visit: www.fidelity.com
*   On the homepage, click “Open an Account” in the top right corner.

### Step 2: Choose the Right Account Type

Here are 3 great options based on your goals: - **Custodial Account (UGMA/UTMA)** - Great for investing for a child or teen under 18 - The adult controls it until the child becomes a legal adult - Click: “Open a custodial account” - **Roth IRA for Kids** (If you have earned income) - Ideal for teens with part-time jobs or side hustles - Money grows tax-free - Go to “Open a Roth IRA,” then select the “Minor Roth IRA” option. - **Brokerage Account (Individual)** - Best for young adults or 18+ teens ready to invest on their own - Choose “The Fidelity Account (Brokerage)” if you’re 18 or older.

### Step 3: Fill Out the Application

*   Enter personal info (name, address, Social Security number)
*   For custodial accounts, both the adult’s and child’s info is required
*   Choose your account preferences (how you want to receive documents, etc.)

### Step 4: Fund Your Account

*   Link your bank account securely
*   You can start with as little as $10-$25
*   Choose one-time or recurring deposits (tip: automate monthly!)

### Step 5: Start Investing!

Once your account is set up and funded: - Search for investments like “S&P 500 Index Fund” (e.g., FXAIX) - For dividend growth: try “SCHD” or “VIG” - Click “Buy,” choose amount, and confirm - **Fractional Shares** = Buy a piece of a stock, not the whole thing! Remember Fractional shares let you buy a piece of a stock instead of the whole thing. For example, if a stock costs $1000 and you only have $100, you can buy 1/10th of one share of that stock.

*   Use their “Learning Center” to build your knowledge
*   Set it and forget it—let compound growth work its magic

If you don’t take the time to learn how to invest, you’ll likely hand your money over to someone else—and pay way more than you realize. Banks and money managers know most people are uncomfortable with money because they were never taught about it at home or in school. They’ll offer to “help” for what seems like a small fee—maybe 1% or 2% a year—but over time, that adds up big.

Here’s the truth: A 2% annual fee might not sound like much, but over decades, it can mean the difference between retiring with $3 million and retiring with $1.8 million. That’s $1.2 million lost—just for paying someone to do something you can learn to do yourself.

And here’s the kicker: Around 90% of money managers don’t even beat the S&P 500.

So why pay more to get less? Learn to invest for yourself. Start by picking up this book—Financial Freedom Faster—and take control of your future.

If you don’t take the time to learn how to invest and hire a money manager instead, you’re going to overpay. Many banks and money managers know that most people are intimidated by money, and they understand you likely didn’t learn about investing at home or in school. They’ll pitch you the idea of paying a small fee for them to manage your money, but what they won’t tell you is that those fees can range from 0.5% to 2% per year. While it may sound like a small amount, it adds up over time.

For example, if your goal is to retire with $2.5 million, and you hire a money manager who charges 2% a year, by the time you retire, you may only have $1.5 million. That’s $1 million lost to fees! And the truth is, most money managers don’t even outperform the market, like the S&P 500.

You don’t need to pay someone else to manage your investments. Learn how to do it yourself and take control of your financial future. Start with books like mine :)- and begin building your wealth today.

## MONEY MOVES #Securethebag

### 5 Actual Money Moves Teens Should Make by 21

#### \+ How Much They’ll Have in 25 Years

#### 1\. Open a Roth IRA and Invest $150/month

**What to Do:** Open a Roth IRA through Fidelity or Schwab. Set up automatic contributions of $150/month into a low-cost index fund like VTI (Vanguard Total Market ETF) or FXAIX (Fidelity 500 Index Fund).

**Why It Works:** Roth IRAs grow tax-free. That means no taxes on your earnings at retirement.

**The Outcome:** If you start at 18 and invest $150/month for just 7 years (until age 25) and stop—by age 50, you could have ~$170,000. If you keep going till age 43? You’re looking at ~$300,000-$350,000 at a 10% average return.

#### 2\. Invest a One-Time $1,000 in the S&P 500

**What to Do:** Put $1,000 into an S&P 500 index fund (like VOO, VUG, or FXAIX).

**Why It Works:** The S&P 500 has historically returned 9-10% annually over the long term.

**The Outcome:** In 25 years, that single $1,000—money that could have easily been blown on stuff you won’t even need or remember—could grow into a five-figure investment if left untouched. This is how money works for you while you sleep. That’s the power of compound interest.

#### 3\. Open a High-Yield Savings Account & Keep $500 Emergency Fund

**What to Do:** Open an account with Ally, SoFi, or Capital One and stash $500. Let it sit.

**Why It Works:** At ~4% APY, your savings grow even while sitting still—perfect for short-term emergencies.

**The Outcome:** After 5 years, $500 becomes ~$610 without touching it. Not huge—but way better than 5 interest at a traditional bank.

#### 4\. Use a Cashback Credit Card for Essentials Only

**What to Do:** Get the Discover It Student Cash Back card. Spend only on gas, food, or bills. Pay in full monthly.

**Why It Works:** Builds credit + earns cashback you can reinvest.

**The Outcome:** Spend $200/month and get 5% cashback = $10/month = $120/year. Invest that $120 annually from age 18-21 = $480 invested total At 10% growth = ~$5,250 after 25 years

#### 5\. Launch a Side Hustle & Invest the Profits

**What to Do:** Start tutoring or selling on Etsy. Set a goal to earn $100/month and invest it all.

**Why It Works:** Turns your skills into long-term assets.

**The Outcome:** $100/month invested from 18 to 25 = $8,400 total At 10% growth, by age 50 that turns into ~$115,000.

### Bonus Move: Turn 18th Birthday Money into a Million

Say you get $2,000 from gifts, part-time work, or graduation. If you invest it in an index fund and never touch it—at 10% growth for 47 years (age 18 to 65), it becomes ~$152,000. But add $150/month from age 18 to 65? You’re retiring with over $1 million.

## What Are Dividends (and Why Should You Care)?

Dividends are a crucial part of investing that we can’t overlook—they’re the rewards companies give back to their investors, and they can help grow your wealth over time! They are like thank-you checks from a company just for owning a piece of their stock. This payout is called a dividend, and it usually shows up in your account quarterly. Take the cash, or better yet, reinvest it to buy more shares and grow your money even faster. It’s like passive income—you’re making money just by holding on to your stock. Note not all companies pay dividends, but the ones that do tend to be more stable and well-established.

**Popular Dividend-Paying Index Funds:** - Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO): Tracks the S&P 500 and distributes dividends quarterly. - Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD): Focuses on high-dividend-paying U.S. stocks. - Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG): Tracks companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time.

### Turning $50 into $1,000,000: A Teen’s Roadmap to Wealth

#### Building Wealth from Just $50: Step-by-Step Teen Game Plan

#### Step 1: Open a Roth IRA or Brokerage Account

**Action:** Use a teen-friendly platform like Fidelity Youth (ages 13-17 with a parent) or open a Roth IRA once you have earned income (age 18+). **Why:** Tax-free growth = millionaire potential.

#### Step 2: Invest Your First $50

**Action:** Choose a low-cost index fund like Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) or Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD). **Why:** These funds grow with the market and often pay dividends.

#### Step 3: Set Up Automatic Contributions

**Action:** Aim to add just $50/month. Set it and forget it as if it were spent on fast food. **Why:** Consistency + compound interest = serious growth.

#### Step 4: Reinvest Your Dividends

**Action:** Turn on “DRIP” (dividend reinvestment plan) in your account settings. **Why:** Dividends buying more shares = faster compounding.

#### Step 5: Stay Invested, Stay Patient

**Action:** Ignore the noise. Don’t panic when the market drops. Keep learning and growing. **Why:** A monthly investment of $50 can build over $100,000 or even $1M.

As a matter of fact, with a 10% average annual return you’d reach $1,000,000 in about 40 years. That is just with $50/month. If you can increase that monthly amount as you earn more, say to $100/month, you could get there in about 33 years.

Building wealth from just $50 may seem impossible, but with smart investing, patience, and financial discipline, and time on your side, it’s absolutely achievable. Here’s a step-by-step roadmap to help teens grow a small amount of money into long-term financial success.

The most valuable asset you have is time, and the earlier you start, the easier the journey to wealth becomes!

It is inconceivable that some high school juniors and seniors have never heard of the NYSE or even know where Wall Street is located. This realization hit me during a math lesson on compound interest. I wanted to make it real, so I brought up the stock market—and that’s when the spark happened. My students were locked in, eyes wide, asking questions, making connections. They were excited to learn. No one had ever explained it to them in a way that clicked. And just like that, a lesson, a teachable moment turned into a mission, a movement. That moment is when this book was born.

Because once they understood the power of investing—once they heard that “the most powerful force in the universe is compound interest”—they leaned in. They wanted to know more. They deserved to know more. And I knew I couldn’t stop there. If we want to shift generational wealth, we have to start right here, right now—in the classroom, in the community, and in our homes. Not another generation should graduate without this knowledge.

My gratitude is etched deep and forever for the chance to spark change, ignite curiosity, and leave an imprint that could ripple through generations. I am indelibly grateful, beyond measure, for the opportunity.

Now go on! Start… Step into your power, take charge of your destiny, and build the wealth and life you deserve. The world is waiting for you to show up and make it happen.
